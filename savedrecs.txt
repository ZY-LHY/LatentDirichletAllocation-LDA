TI	Adverse childhood experiences and repetitive negative thinking in adulthood: A systematic review
SO	CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
DI	10.1002/cpp.2590
EA	APR 2021
PY	2021
AB	Background It has been proposed that repetitive negative thinking (worry and rumination) may be more common among adults who have been exposed to childhood adverse experiences, leading to emotional disorders and other adverse outcomes. The current study aims to present a comprehensive evaluation of the literature examining the relationship between the exposure to childhood adversities, repetitive negative thinking and clinical outcomes in adulthood.Methods In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, a search was conducted on PubMed and Ebsco. A manual search of reference lists was also run. Search terms were 'childhood adversity/childhood abuse/childhood neglect/early loss event AND worry or rumination'.Results A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. In both non-clinical and clinical populations, worry and rumination seem to be common among adults exposed to childhood abuse or childhood neglect. Among adults who have been exposed to childhood adversities, rumination seems to be associated with worse clinical outcomes such as severe psychiatric symptoms, depression, dysphoria, suicidal ideation, cognitive complaints, post-traumatic stress symptoms and aggression.Conclusion Early experiences of abuse and neglect may be associated with a tendency to engage in repetitive negative thinking, such as worry and rumination, in adulthood. Among adults, with a history of childhood adversities, tailored treatment to reduce repetitive negative thinking should be considered.

AB	PurposeThis paper aims to discover the key challenges and identifies reasons for the changing behavior of academic libraries and the role of library professionals, and how can they manage those challenges in a time of change. The paper reveals the most important competencies in a reshaping environment of libraries and the best ways of dealing with change. Library professionals are struggling to reform their traditional ways of working and trying to boost their knowledge and skills as current demand for higher education. Organizations can play an important role to develop willingness for accepting change and reduce stress among employees and prepare them to accept new systems and reality by creating collaborative and supporting environments that provide opportunities for growth and improvement. All library professionals must have the eagerness to keep up with the emerging trends and prepare themselves to accept changes that would have a direct impact on the libraries and the role of library professionals. Academic libraries have similar issues and challenges around the world, those are outcomes of technological advancement, digital resources, innovative services and diversity in higher education; therefore, the role of library professionals is changing.Design/methodology/approachThe research method is built on literature reviews from offline and online. The systematic literature review method is used to review full-text databases such as EBSCO, ProQuest, Library Literature and Information Science databases. Basic search options for keyword searching and advanced searching options have been used to retrieve the relevant papers on the right topic. A total of 113 papers were collected at the initial stage, but after their analysis in detail, they were reduced to 52 scholarly and peer-reviewed papers because the rest of the papers did not exactly express relevant content on the topic.FindingsLibrary professionals are struggling to keep up with the new competencies and adopt the innovative system and reality because diversity is rapidly changing. The best ways of dealing with change include reform the traditional ways to new ways of working and create collaboration at all levels. Librarians are under pressure to develop new skills to deal with the current scenarios that are affecting the role of library professionals. Academic libraries have similar challenges in a rapidly reshaping environment that are needed to address by researchers and library professionals for the present and future of academic libraries.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper is a piece of opinion, 52 appropriate papers on the topic have been reviewed from the peer-reviewed journals, not all publications were included. The existing literature described that there is a need for growth and improvement of academic libraries and workforce in financial crises because they play fundamental roles in society by offering services and information resources, so library professionals need to be very aware of these implications.Originality/valueThe literature on this particular topic is relatively limited. Therefore, this paper is the first to offer a systematic literature review on the changing behavior of academic libraries and the role of library professionals. This paper provides insights into the concept of adopting change and dealing with challenges in a time of change. It adds value to the library and information sciences literature and delivers outlines for the library professionals.

AB	Purpose The confusion over what counts as "strategic" is widely acknowledged to be a problem for both research and practice. The paper aims to develop a robust definition of "strategic decisions" and a classifying tool that distinguishes them from grand tactical, tactical, and other organizational decisions. Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature review focused on the leading journals is carried out. Articles having "strategic decision" in the abstract are retrieved from EBSCO Host and ProQuest One Academic databases. Definitions of "strategic decisions" are critically assessed and classified to form the trigger and basis of the development of new definition. Findings The literature review identifies five approaches by which strategic decisions are defined, and their limitations are exposed. The proposed definitions of "strategic," grand tactical, and tactical decisions, and the novel classification tree, used to distinguish those decisions, are shown to be more accurate and robust than those previously offered in the literature. Originality/value New definitions of "strategic," grand tactical, and tactical decisions are offered; and a new classifying tool is developed.

AB	The objective of this study, focuses on carrying out a literature review of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as an exclusive factor affecting consumer behavior. The methodology has a descriptive scope of a bibliographic type, studies were selected that have been published in the most important indexes worldwide, in the following order: Web of Science, Scopus, Ebsco and ProQuest, from 2009 to 2020, with a total of 62 publications among scientific articles, books and thesis, which discussed the development of ICT exclusively focused on the modern consumer. A considerable scientific production found between 2013 and 2017 with 47,00% of the documents analyzed. Likewise, in these publications key words such as ICT, digital consumers and consumer behavior are highlighted with 27,00%, 19,00% and 10,00% respectively. Regarding the origin of the documents, it is highlighted that most of them come from Latin America with a percentage of 53,00%. As main conclusions it is highlighted that the intervention of the TIC is immersed in almost all the phases of the decision making that the consumer makes, in addition to it, the present consumers are permanently connected, having greater alternatives of election according to the information that the company develops to reach the final purchase of the product and/or service.

AB	Change of direction movement is common in sports and the ability to perform this complex movement efficiently is related to athlete's performance. Wearable devices have been used to evaluate aspects of change of direction movement, but so far there are no clear recommendations on specific metrics to be used.The aims of this scoping review were to evaluate the reliability and validity of inertial measurement unit sensors to provide information on change of direction movement and to summarize the available evidence on inertial measurement units in analyzing change of direction movement in sports.A systematic search was employed in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO host), SPORTDiscus (EBSCO host), EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science to identify eligible studies. A complementary grey literature search was employed to locate non-peer reviewed studies. The risk of bias of the studies evaluating validity and/or reliability was evaluated using the AXIS tool.The initial search identified 15,165 studies. After duplicate removal and full-text screening 49 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 11 studies evaluating validity and/or reliability.There are promising results on the validity and reliability, but the number of studies is still small and the quality of the studies is limited. Most of the studies were conducted with pre-planned movements and participants were usually adult males. Varying sensor locations limits the ability to generalize these findings. Inertial measurement units (IMU) can be used to detect change of direction (COD) movements and COD heading angles with acceptable validity, but IMU measured or derived kinetic or kinematic variables present inconsistency and over-estimation.Studies can be improved with larger sample sizes and agreement on the metrics used and sensor placement. Future research should include more on-field studies.

AB	BackgroundNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) might benefit from aspirin desensitization (AD) as an alternative treatment to standard care. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding its role in bronchial symptoms and asthma exacerbations.ObjectiveTo analyze the clinical effects of AD in terms of lung function, systemic and inhaled steroid use, the frequency of acute asthma exacerbations, and adverse effects in patients with NERD and asthma.MethodologyWe identified randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and EBSCO. We also searched the RCT references for additional studies. Studies comparing AD to placebo in patients with a previous history of pulmonary symptoms triggered by ASA or other NSAIDs or with a positive provocation test to ASA were included.Primary resultsFive studies with 210 participants with NERD were included in this review. The study duration ranged from 3 to 6 months. Overall, the risk of bias across the included RCTs was low. We identified 3 studies evaluating lung function, 2 of which reported a significant improvement in FEV1 in the AD group after 6 months, while the other reported no difference among the treatments. Due to high heterogeneity, we did not pool the results. The remaining primary outcomes were reported only in a single study each, hindering their interpretation. Secondary outcomes revealed reduced symptom and medication scores in patients with AD.ConclusionsDue to the small number of studies included in this systematic review, conclusions should be made with caution. AD shows a trend towards improving lung function (FEV1) following 6 months of treatment, although no conclusions can be made regarding the use of corticosteroids or the frequency of acute exacerbations. AD appears to reduce both symptom and medication scores. Additional RCTs are needed to fully assess the efficacy of AD in reducing bronchial symptoms in patients with NERD.

AB	The COVID-19 pandemic has made librarians responsible for children's book collections in academic libraries acutely aware of the need to acquire children's and young adult materials in electronic formats. This research project compared the availability of 1,600 award-winning and professionally-recognized PreK-12 titles within the e-book platforms of EBSCO, Follett, Hoopla, Mackin, Overdrive, ProQuest, and Tumblebooks. In addition, the authors examined the availability of children's ebooks pertaining to racial/ethnic, gender, LGBTQ+, and disability diversity from these vendors. The results of this study indicated that there were substantial disparities in the availability of e-books by grade level and by publisher. The availability of titles pertaining to people of color, women, LGBTQ + persons, and people with disabilities was usually (but not always) similar or better compared to the availability of all titles in the dataset.

EA	MAR 2021
PY	2021
AB	A growing movement towards inclusive education worldwide means more children with autism are being educated in mainstream classrooms. However, integration does not equate to inclusion, and peer stigmatisation of autism is commonplace. This systematic review explores the merit of school-based peer education interventions targeting the stigmatisation of children with autism spectrum disorders. Relevant records published from 1994 were identified through systematic searches of five electronic databases: EBSCO, Medline, PsychInfo, PsychArticles and ERIC. Thirty-one documents pertaining to 27 studies met the pre-specified eligibility criteria and were included for data-extraction. A narrative synthesis highlighted significant flaws in the available literature, most notably poor methodological quality and a narrow research focus with regards to age, the gender of target child and implementation methods. Nevertheless, this study reports on evidence tentatively supporting the efficacy of ASD de-stigmatisation interventions when targeting ignorance and prejudice. Although no one approach can be determined as most effective, manualised programmes combining different types of information about ASD and delivered using various mediums seem to hold the most promise.

EA	MAR 2021
PY	2021
AB	Systematic literature reviews are common in social research for integrating and synthesising existing research. This paper argues that the outcomes of such reviews are affected by the choice of bibliographic databases. It presents evidence of substantial variation across three large electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO) in a study on employee retention and staff turnover. It considers the specific articles, numbers returned, numbers shared across databases and perceived quality of journals hosting the retrieved articles. Results show that only 130 articles (5.7% of 2267 retrieved) were found common to all three databases, suggesting that decisions on how and where literature is retrieved can substantially affect the results of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The findings caution against the use of single databases and claiming comprehensiveness. The paper reflects on how additional literature search methods (e.g., contacting experts, citation indices) and their sequence of use can affect systematic review quality.

AB	Introduction The rate of diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is on the rise. Families of individuals with ASD usually face challenges in raising their children. The coping strategies that allow for caregivers to prevail and be resilient in this situation need to be better understood. Thus, this review aimed to compile evidences related to resiliency and coping strategies among families of individuals with ASD. Methods We searched several online databases including CINAHL, EBSCO, Embase, and Medline, which yielded 1613 articles. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 25 studies remained for review. Results We found that caregivers use different coping strategies and report different stressors that are influenced by their partners support and resiliency. Positive cognitions can mediate the effects of raising a child with ASD, and the severity of the child's symptoms is one of the greatest influences on maternal well-being. Conclusion The majority of previous studies are cross sectional or descriptive. It is crucial that empirical, longitudinal research establish a cogent picture of parental resiliency. A clearer picture of resiliency will help outline the ways in which parents can increase their well-being and quality of life, and this will support advancing the child resiliency and interventions that might be adopted.

AB	The objective of this review article is to analyze the impact of metacognitive strategies on the reading comprehension of high school students. The study was carried out within the framework of the methodology defined in the PRISMA Declaration. Information was also recovered from databases such as Scopus, Springer, Ebsco, Erick, Redalyc, Scielo, Dialnet, etc., published between 2004 and 2020, which were reviewed in a matrix that allowed the identification of their objectives, designs, instructional programs, results and contributions. The identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion took place over a period of two months. Out of a group of 210 studies explored, only 17 were included. Among the inclusion criteria, research articles and case studies related to metacognitive strategies and reading comprehension of high school students stand out. On the other hand, among the exclusion criteria, those that do not meet scientific rigor, that present methodological inconsistencies or whose relationship does not correspond to the study categories were considered. The results show that the interventions of metacognitive strategies demonstrate effectiveness in the improvement of reading comprehension of students at the secondary level

AB	Background The overlap between criminal justice system involvement and drug use is well-documented, and criminal justice agencies have been particularly overwhelmed by the recent opioid epidemic. Treating opioid (and other substance) addiction as a means to reduce risk for future criminality and improve public safety is inherently a responsibility for the criminal justice system. In turn, the criminal justice system has a responsibility to manage and treat addiction among the individuals under its purview. Policy recommendations place emphasis on the use of medication-assisted treatments (MAT) as a front-line defense among correctional populations, because its efficacy and effectiveness has been well-established in other contexts. Despite this, criminal justice agencies have been reluctant or slow to do so.Objectives The current review will provide criminal justice and substance use treatment decision-makers with information regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of opioid-specific MAT on offending and overdose outcomes. Specifically, the authors will address the following research questions: Do opioid-specific MATs reduce the frequency or likelihood of criminal justice outcomes, as defined by official or self-reported indices of criminal reconviction or rearrest, revocation of community supervision, mandated treatment failure, and specialized court docket failure? Do opioid-specific MATs reduce the frequency of opioid overdose among individuals with current or prior self-reported or official record of criminal justice system involvement?Inclusion Criteria Studies were required to use strong quasi-experimental or randomized experimental designs. All studies used individual level unit of analysis and examined adults and adolescents who are male, female, or nonbinary and racially/ethnically diverse, with current opioid use and who have current or prior criminal justice involvement. Studies had to prospectively test the effects of heroin and methadone maintenance, buprenorphine, or naltrexone on criminal conviction, arrest, revocation of community supervision, technical probation or parole violation, mandated treatment failure, and specialized court docket failure. Overdose outcomes were also examined for samples in criminal justice settings such as jails, prisons, probation, and parole.Search Strategy and Data Collection This review builds upon a prior review conducted by Egli et al. (2009) and examined studies meeting the inclusion criteria above published between 1960 and October 31, 2020. The following platforms and databases (in parentheticals) were used: EBSCOhost (Criminal Justice s, SocINDEX with Full Text, Legal Collection, Wilson Omnifile, PsycINFO, Social Work s, and Women's Studies International [includes grey literature]); ProQuest (Criminal Justice Database, PAIS [includes grey literature], Dissertations and Theses Global [includes grey literature]); Gale (Expanded Academic ASAP, Opposing Viewpoints Resource Center); FirstSearch (GPO Monthly Catalog, PapersFirst [includes grey literature]); ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science Core Collection); Office of Justice Programs (National Criminal Justice Reference Service); Summon; and Nexis Uni. The following open access platforms and databases will also be consulted: Elsevier (Scopus [includes grey literature]); Science.gov; ClinicalTrials.gov; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal; and Google Scholar.Search terms were harvested according to their demonstrated success in drawing out relevant and complete results for studies regarding the effectiveness of opioid-specific medication-assisted therapies (MATs). From this process 5 core search strings were created, each one with the same general base terms, but unique outcome measure(s).Analysis For binary offending outcomes (e.g., arrest, conviction, incarceration, specialty court failure, mandated treatment failure, or community supervision failure) and overdose outcomes, odds ratios were computed, and for continuous or quasi-continuous outcomes (e.g., total number of arrests), a standardized mean difference type effect size was computed and then transformed into an odds ratio. We used the chi(2) test that goes with the forest plot and computed the I-2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. Risk of bias was assessed with (1) the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials; and (2) the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions assessment tool.

AB	The set of strategies developed by teachers to achieve learning is called methodology, which has been virtualized as a consequence of the pandemic suffered by the planet. The objective was to systematize the scientific evidence on virtual methodology, which is developed in university contexts and can be applied by the educational community. The methodology developed in this research was retrospective from 2010 to 2020; peer-reviewed articles were identified from the Scopus, Ebsco and Eric databases, under the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Boolean operators "and" and "or", and search equations in Spanish and English languages were used, identifying 40 scientific articles that complied with the structured process, which answered the question "What virtual methodologies have been applied in university contexts?" The results show that Flipped classroom is the most used methodology, followed by problem-based learning and b-Learning methodology. It should also be noted that the emerging platforms are Blackboard Collaborate, Moodle and WebCT. It is concluded that it is necessary to detail the methods that facilitate teaching and learning, that are innovative and that at the same time promote the relationship between teachers and students.

AB	Researchers have extensively examined and reviewed the relationship of the profile of mood states (POMS) with sport performance since the 1970s. Two decades have passed since the last POMS quantitative review. Our overall objective was to quantify the POMS research with competitive athletes with a prospective measured POMS and a sport performance outcome in the published literature. Additionally, we tested potential moderators of the mental health model (i.e., sport duration, type, and skill) with meta-analytic techniques while considering potential risk bias across study sources. Based on a systematic review, the articles were found using EBSCO and comparing these articles with extensive past POMS in sport and exercise bibliographies. Search terms included profile of mood states (POMS) or iceberg profile or the mental health model with sport and performance or sports performance. For selection, articles must have reported data on competitive athletes, an athletic performance outcome, and a valid form of the POMS measured prospectively. After screening more than 600 articles for inclusion, 25 articles provided sufficient data for effect size calculations. The included articles spanned from 1975 to 2011, with 1497 unique participants. Hedges' g values were generally small for the six POMS scales: tension (-0.21), depression (-0.43), anger (-0.08), vigor (0.38), fatigue (-0.13), and confusion (-0.41). However, the total mood disturbance (TMD) score effect size was medium in magnitude at -0.53. When corrected for potential publication bias, the effect size values increased in magnitude for tension (-0.47), depression (-0.64), vigor (0.44), fatigue (-0.34), and TMD (-0.84). Moderator analyses for Terry's (1995) propositions and for risk of bias across studies, statistically, resulted in few differences based on conventional statistical significance (p < 0.05). Measured before performance, most of the POMS scales and TMD are reliable predictors of sport performance in competitive athletes across a wide variety of sports and athletic performance outcomes. Morgan's (1980, 1985) mental health model or iceberg profile minus anger is still a viable method for understanding and improving athletic performances.

AB	Customer journey has become an increasingly important concept to understand complex customer behaviours and get insights into their experiences. While the term has been used in diverse disciplines since the 1990s and its literature has grown more than sevenfold over the last eight years, understanding of the topic remains incoherent. This paper adopted a stream-based systematic review approach to identify the underlying themes of the customer journey presented in the business literature up to May 2020. 147 relevant papers were retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO for the analysis. The quantitative content analysis identified five underlying themes of the customer journey, namely, service satisfaction, failure and recovery, co-creation, customer response, channels and technological disruption. The results section reviewed and discussed each theme and its sub-themes in turn. The review identified important gaps in the literature related to the key stages of a customer journey.

AB	Employee health is not only positively related to the employee well-being and family happiness, but also impacts organizations, and society as a whole. We searched the health-promoting leadership literature in the following databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, EBSCO, and a Chinese local database. Based on this research, we clarify the concept of health-promoting leadership, propose a definition of health-promoting leadership, and examine measurement scales for this type of leadership. We also suggest a research framework for health-promoting leadership, demonstrating its potential outcomes at both the individual level (e.g., health, well-being, job attitudes) and the organizational level (e.g., health management culture and practices); the mechanisms for its development based on conservation of resources theory, the job demands-resources model, social learning theory, and social exchange theory; and antecedents (e.g., health values, health awareness, organizational health culture, organizational health climate, and organizational health promotion behavior control). Finally, we identify six potential research areas: Research level, performance, the impacts of health-promoting leaders on themselves, moderators, research methods, and intervention effects on health-promoting leadership.

AB	Social Stories (SS) is a widely used intervention for children on the autism spectrum. A search of databases (CINAH EBSCO, A+Eductaion, ERIC, Education Source, PsyINFO, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and ABI Inform Global) identified that, since its development over 25 years ago, the research exploring SS has been reviewed 17 times. These reviews include synthesis of literature; systematic reviews, meta-analyses; comparative reviews; and descriptive reviews. A scoping review of these 17 literature reviews identified 5 major themes: (1) research design of SS studies, (2) effectiveness of SS, (3) factors influencing outcomes of SSs, (4) social validity of SS interventions, and (5) maintenance and generalisation of SS outcomes. Future recommendations related to SS research were also identified.

AB	This article aims to portray industrial workers' vocational training during Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in Spain (1923-1930), based on the Industrial Training Act of 1924 and the Vocational Training Act of 1928. The programme was devised to meet the modernising expectations of a conventional society. The grounds for government interventionism were laid down in a new curriculum based on the Work School, influenced by the aims of the New School, whose main objective was to create citizens and technicians. Accordingly, this article analyses, on the one hand, the ideological context that fostered the rebirth of industry-oriented training, and the influence of social Taylorism and the New School movement on the design of a newly humanised-technological programme; and, on the other hand, the corporate political manipulation by Primo de Rivera's dictatorship of the new model of training based on work schools, influenced by the idea of reactionary modernisation.

AB	This article is the result of a review of existing research on masculinity in the university context. The objective of this study was to determine the topics of analysis, characteristics and trends of recent studies in this field. A search was conducted on Scopus and Ebsco, using the search terms: masculinity and university students, which yielded 72 studies for analysis The most explored topics among the research reviewed were: the construction of masculinity, male social norms and gender stereotypes, romantic relationships, masculinity and health, attitudes toward sexual minorities and their effects, masculinity and violence, and masculinity and alcohol consumption and the recognition of new models of masculinities. It concluded that the formation of masculinity in the university environment is a complex experience, influenced by the mix of traditional masculinity and overlaid with cultural, social, historical, and personal factors.

TI	Modified total interpretive structural modelling of innovation implementation antecedents
SO	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
DI	10.1108/IJPPM-05-2020-0239
EA	JAN 2021
PY	2021
AB	Purpose The paper aims to identify, analyse and develop a model for measuring the inter-relationship and interaction among the antecedents influencing innovation implementation. The extant literature has not widely studied the interactions and inter-relationships among the antecedents of innovation implementation. To fill this gap, the paper develops a hierarchical relationship framework between the identified antecedents of innovation implementation. Design/methodology/approach The study follows mixed method-based approach using two methodologies: modified total interpretive structural modelling (m-TISM) and MICMAC (Matriced' Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee a un Classement) analysis. m-TISM is used for the purpose of establishing the hierarchical relationship among the antecedents. MICMAC analysis is used to study the driver-dependent relationship. To identify the antecedents of innovation implementation, the paper follows a systematic search method found in the review articles. The article search was performed across different databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO and Scopus. Findings In this study, eight innovation implementation antecedents are identified. The analysis indicates that competency antecedents such as leader competency and employee competency, having high driving and weak dependence power, are at the lowest level in the hierarchical model, whereas, innovation implementation, having high dependence and low driving power, is at the highest level in the hierarchical model. Strategic resources act as a linkage variable. Research limitations/implications Although this study summarizes the extant literature to generalize the findings, the future studies can focus upon statistical validation of model by employing structural equation modelling to generalize the results. Practical implications The practitioners must emphasize on antecedents having strong driving power for successful implementation of innovation. The hierarchical model is proposed for implementing innovation successfully that will help organizations to be more competitive, productive and profitable. Originality/value In this study, m-TISM and MICMAC-based hierarchical models are proposed for implementing innovation successfully in organizations. It also provides the variables insights such as driver-dependent interrelationship between the identified antecedents.

AB	Neuroscience influences education, and these two areas have converged in a new field denominated "Neuroeducation." However, the growing interest in the education-brain relationship does not match the proper use of research findings. In 2007, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned of the misunderstandings about the brain among teachers, labeling them as neuromyths. The main objective here is to observe the prevalence of the neuromyths in educators over time. After two decades of publications of research on neuromyths among in-service or prospective teachers, this work presents a systematic scientific review. To select the articles, we used the words: "teachers," "preservice teachers," "neuromyths" combined with the Boolean data type "and." The search was filtered according to the following criteria: (a) identifiable author, (b) written in English, Spanish, French, Italian, or Portuguese, (c) word neuromyth in title, abstract, or keywords, (d) research with a participant's survey, (e) sample focused on educators, (f) peer-review publication index in JCR, SJR, or ESCI. The documents were found through Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Dialnet, ProQuest, EBSCO-host, and Google Scholar. After the search, 24 articles were identified as being of sufficiently high quality for this systematic review. This result highlights that neuromyths are still the subject of attention almost two decades after their definition. The findings present neuromyths as the consequence of a lack of scientific knowledge, a communicative gap between scientists and teachers, and the low-quality information sources consulted by teachers. In addition, the data on protectors and predictors of neuromyths is inconsistent. There is also no standard scientific methodology nor a guideline to determine a new neuromyth. The results show the need to improve the scientific content in higher education and the importance of in-service teacher training. This research justifies the requirement for university professors to be active researchers and to establish a close link with educators from other fields and levels. Neuroeducation will be the bridge that unites scientific knowledge and practical application in education, with a rigorous, standard method for the entire scientific-educational community.

AB	I was sitting in a conference room with my new labmates, eager to engage about the exciting research we were all working on. Halfway through the meeting-my first as a Ph.D. student-I tried to contribute a couple of sentences. Suddenly, the room went quiet and I got lots of funny looks. I was overcome with embarrassment as I realized what had happened. Speaking about water movement in a river basin, I meant to say "upstream" and "downstream." But instead my brain had gone with a word-by-word translation of the terms in my first language, Farsi: " high-hand" and "lowhand." This was just the first of many times my brain failed to summon the right English words.

AB	Research about of job stress at university contexts has not been exempt from conceptual and methodological difficulties, therefore the objective of this systematic review is to analyze the main methodological and instrumental aspects in studies published between 2010 and 2019, on job stress in professor, administrative and support staff working in Latin American universities. Following the suggested by the PRISMA model, it was consulted the databases: LA Reference, Dialnet, Scopus, EBSCO and Web of Science, obtaining 258 papers that, after a debugging process, derivated 6 studies for their final review. The results show that all the studies were quantitative, with nonexperimental and cross-sectional designs, and with descriptive scopes. In -addition, the use of 15 instruments that mainly assess work stress and occupational risk factors was detected. Theoretical and methodological implications derived from the findings are discussed.

AB	This paper aims at exploring the educational scholarly writing on the teacher-student relationship and performance within the use of Social Network Sites (SNSs) for educational purposes. To that end, a systematic review of 111 journal articles focused on young people, and found in ten relevant databases (ERIC, SCOPUS, WOS, JCR (SSCI), DOAJ, EBSCO, ISOC, REDIB, JSTOR, and PsycARTICLES), has been performed. The results show continuity in the roles of educators and students between physical and virtual spaces. This homogeneous conceptualisation is grounded on student-centred theories. Also, the existence of a theoretical confrontation between the figurative dichotomy of vertical (distance) and horizontal (closeness) teacher-student relationship is revealed and discussed. While most of the reviewed studies focused on requirements for technical training, the need for acquiring digital cultural knowledge is stressed. Finally, some of the educational implications of the ethical dimension of the teacher-student relationship in digital spaces are exposed.

Through an integrative literature review, we sought to investigate the possible relationships between family, school and specialists in the development of autistic people. The search was carried out on the websites EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS), Pubnned, Google Scholar and CAPES Periodicals using the descriptors "autism" + "family" + "school" + "specialist" + "review" + "development", written in Portuguese and in English, considered as a time frame the publications made between the years 2016 and 2019. Twenty articles in Portuguese and English were selected and analyzed dealing with the theme. The data was treated using the content analysis method. It was indicated that through the acquisition of knowledge, mutual collaboration and facing challenges of the condition by the aforementioned groups, it is possible to assist in the development of autistic people.

AB	In the migration Mexico to the United States, when inmigrants are excluded from social assistance programs, they begin to manifest a series of clinical symptoms. The objective of this article was to review the literature to distinguish among such symptoms as indications that the migratory process alters their mental or social functioning, or these are defensive responses. An article pool from the EBSCO database was used.The qualitative analysis allowed us to observe that, faced with the multiplicity and chronicity of the symptoms manifested, the feeling of hopelessness and fear that ties them by the hands of the migrants dominates. It is urgent to do emotional support work so that they regain their inner strength and regain control of their lives. 5 strategies are proposed to create synergies of active coping, called strategic bridges. Making the differentiation by age, condition of forced family separation and other psychosocial variables.

AB	Intimate partner violence is a phenomenon that generates serious public health problems and has been primarily studied in heterosexual relationships, meaning it has been studied less frequently in same-sex couples.Therefore, this systematic review synthesizes the methodological and ethical aspects of studies on violence in couples consisting of gay men and men who have sex with men (MSM), published in the last two decades in international journals. Following the PRISMA methodology, the Scopus, Clarivate, EBSCO, Science Direct, Scielo and LA Reference databases were searched and from a total of 292 studies located, 17 articles were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria through a process of debugging divided into four phases. Results showed that a quantitative approach, and non-experimental and cross section designs predominated, as well as the inclusion of nonprobabilistic and non-representative samples.Also, inconsistencies were found in the ethical aspects of psychological research and a lack of specialized instruments for same-sex couples. The results and methodological implications are discussed, prioritizing the urgency of future studies focused on the needs and characteristics of this population.

AB	Problem identification: Loneliness is common after cancer, contributing to poor outcomes. Interventions to modify loneliness are needed. This systematic review describes the current literature regarding loneliness interventions in cancer survivors.Literature search: Databases including: Ovid/MEDLINE; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Elsevier/Embase; Clarivate/Web of Science (Core Collection), EBSCO/PsycINFO, EBSCO/CINAHL were used to perform a systematic review of literature using PRISMA guidelines. Second, risk of bias, meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis approach was completed to synthesize findings from multiple studies.Data evaluation/synthesis: Six thousand five hundred three studies were initially evaluated; eight studies met inclusion criteria. Findings indicate a paucity of interventions, generally of lower quality. Interventions were feasible and acceptable; those interventions with cultural modifications were more likely to demonstrate effectiveness.Conclusions: There are limited interventions addressing loneliness in cancer survivors. Development and testing of culturally-relevant programs are warranted.Implications for psychosocial oncology: Current studies suggest the psychosocial symptom of loneliness is modifiable among adult cancer survivors. Few interventions have been tested and shown to be effectiveness in cancer survivors in the U.S. and none have been tailored for older adult survivors, by patient gender/sex and few for specific race/ethnic groups. Results from this systematic review: a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis can inform future interventions targeting loneliness in this growing, yet vulnerable, adult cancer survivor population.

AB	PurposeThis study aims to review the existing literature on corporate-level strategy to develop a conceptual framework of the headquarters' roles as well as situational factors influencing them.Design/methodology/approachThe systematic review is conducted. Accordingly, 598 studies (published from 1962-2018) were extracted from three databases (ProQuest, EBSCO and Web of Science). Then, after screening and ensuring the quality by the TAPUPAS checklist, 53 articles were systematically analyzed by manual coding method.FindingsIn total, 31 interventions in the form of four roles, namely, "value creation," "value reduction," "portfolio management" and "loss prevent" were identified for headquarters (HQ). Furthermore, four influencing situational factors distinguish "business characteristics," "headquarters characteristics," "corporate company characteristics" and "characteristic of the HQ-subsidiary relationships."Originality/valueThe value of this research can be outlined as: mapping the cutting edge on the topic and systematizes the current knowledge; presenting an integrative, unique conceptual framework of HQs' roles and influences, and particularly, of situational factors that determine the consequents of the interventions; and producing practical insights for corporate parent managers considering the situational factors influencing HQs' roles and influences in managing their business portfolio successfully.

AB	Inclusive education is recognized as a process to identify and respond to the diversity of students and achieve greater participation in the community and in their learning. This topic of great interest to the field of Human and Educational Sciences, requires an analysis of the research processes carried out, in order to generate innovative strategies to be implemented in school guidance and within the classroom. The objective of this systematic review on inclusive education was to identify trends in working with students, teachers, families and institutions. 50 scientific articles were selected in Psicodoc, Science Direct, APA PsycNET y EBSCO. The results are presented in four categories of analysis. In general, with students, it was evident that they focus on understanding experiences and improving the climate in the classroom; with teachers, the analysis of pedagogical practices and professional training needs were identified; with families, it was observed that the processes within the family nucleus have not been given sufficient attention; and at the institutional level, there is a clear interest in monitoring educational processes and policy compliance in order to improve the conditions for inclusion at all levels of education. In conclusion, although the work with different educational actors is evident, greater articulation between them is required. In this sense, teachers and school counselors can take this review as an input to motivate active participation in the application of pedagogical tools, the strengthening of family practices, teacher training and the generation of institutional policies aimed at inclusion.

AB	The main goal of this article is to define the characteristics of and to evaluate the three selected models used to measure the performance of public administration bodies, with an emphasis placed on their application in different perspectives. The contemporary public administration institutions are obligated to increase their operating efficiency as well as the satisfaction of their stakeholders. This is precisely why they have been implementing diverse models, especially those already used for years in managing profit-oriented organisations. The models chosen for analysis are applied in public administration, making it possible to measure numerous indicators of both financial and nonfinancial nature. The research method adopted by the authors is a conceptual literature review performed using the resources of the Scopus, Springer, WoS, Emerald, and EBSCO databases. The items subject to analysis were the 3Es (i.e., economy, efficiency, effectiveness) and IOO (e.g., input, output, and outcome) models as well as the model included in the BSC (Balance Scorecard). The research has evidenced that each of the models has its strengths and limitations. The results thus obtained have led to a conclusion that the solution showing the highest potential in the area of the study is the performance measurement model proposed under the BSC; however, according to the authors, it still requires some fine-tuning to public administration's operating conditions and organisational culture. The article also highlights the fundamental operationalisation problems related to the subject in question.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the literature to determine how academic librarians are measuring their libraries' institutional level impact on student success as measured by grade point average, a metric commonly used in American education. This paper highlights a range of methods, outcomes and challenges in an initial scoping study. Design/methodology/approach The methodology centered on a literature review of measuring the impact of academic libraries on student success as quantified by grade point average (GPA) from 2010 to present. Searches in ProQuest, EBSCO and Google Scholar were used to identify the relevant literature. Keywords searched in databases included various combinations of academic impact, student success, learning outcomes, library and higher education. Findings The analysis of 15 papers shows that academic librarians have demonstrated a small, nonnegligible positive correlation of library usage on GPA. The results of studies have highlighted that correlation does not prove the cause. Concerns and limitations of studies included using the GPA as a measurement of student success, differences between GPAs in subject areas, timeframes used, sample size collected, student privacy and the meanings of the results. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to articles published in English measuring student success as quantified by GPA and focuses heavily on American sources. Originality/value The research can guide librarians through known challenges and highlight successful designs and study methods used by other academic librarians to measure the impact of the library on student success.

AB	Wayfinding is an issue in complex facilities-including hospitals, airports, and office buildings-and wayfinding difficulties are associated with negative psychological and physiological consequences. In addition, since finding one's way in a building is a prerequisite for successfully using that building, wayfinding has attracted the attention of scholars and decision makers. The goal of this article is to review and synthesize the published literature on wayfinding in interior environments. A systematic search was conducted of four databases: PsychINFO, JSTOR, ProQuest, and EBSCO. A hand search was also conducted. From the initial harvest of 804 records, a total of 84 records met the inclusion criteria for full review. After several rounds of review, four broad domains were identified: (1) wayfinding cognition, (2) wayfinding behavior, (3) individual and group differences, and (4) environmental factors. These domains are used as a framework to organize the findings, and the review shows that the sub-domains most thoroughly addressed in the literature are spatial memories, floor plan configuration, landmarks, signs, and maps. This review can deepen the field's understanding of factors that contribute to interior wayfinding and can serve as a resource for decision makers and designers.

AB	BackgroundAnimal hoarding has been portrayed as a manifestation of hoarding behaviour that is escalating worldwide. Professionals trying to support or help animal hoarders face several challenges due to the lack of systematized information on intervention strategies.AimsTo comprehensively review and systematize the information available on intervention practices with this population.MethodA scoping study was performed using five databases (B-ON, EBSCO, SCOPUS, Web of SCIENCE, PubMed), searching for papers published until March 2020. Fifteen papers were selected and submitted to thematic analysis.ResultsThe main findings point to two main themes: (i) what is done-responding to animal hoarding as an emergency; and (ii) what should be done-responding animal hoarding in a long-term, integrated manner.ConclusionsTo have a consistent strategy that assures better results, it seems relevant to prepare community interventions based on collaborative and solution-focused approaches. In addition, there is a strong need to have more research on animal hoarding and on successful intervention strategies.

AB	The present research aims to understand the feasibility of developing a multidimensional model of performance evaluation for organizational control in companies through ethnographic research. Thus, a bibliographic analysis of the studies presented in the four main events of - the Brazilian organizational studies-the Colloquium of Epistemology and Sociology of Administration Science, CBEO, EnANPAD and EnEO-and in the research bases SPELL and EBSCO. The measurement of performance in a company has become a relevant subject for both academic research and practical application, because organizational control of organizational control serves to evaluate and improve the various organizational processes to establish goals and achieve performance standards that become competitive in the market. Given this context, we can see that there is a vast possibility of development in this field, through an ethnographic research, through an investigation capable of showing practices, people, groups, cultures and networks of social relations that participate differently from the tourist market, since the environment in which companies are increasingly turbulent and unstable, and decision makers are constantly seeking methods to achieve improvements in organizational performance. In this sense, it is concluded that this research offers theoretical information that can help in future studies that seek to develop a multidimensional model of indicators, besides being a source of data on the diversity of organizational indicators.

AB	Test-taking motivation (TTM) has been found to have a profound effect on low-stakes test results. From the components of TTM test-taking effort has been shown to be the strongest predictor of test performance. This article presents an overview of methods and instruments used to measure TTM and effect sizes between test-taking effort and performance found with these instruments. Altogether 104 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis based on literature search in EBSCO Discovery database. Effect sizes for the relationship between test-taking effort and performance were available in 28 studies. The average correlation between self-reported effort and performance was r =.33 and the average correlation between Response Time Effort and performance was r=.72, indicating that these two types of measures could be distinctly different. Educational level was a significant moderator of the effect sizes: the average correlation between test-taking effort and performance was stronger for university students than for school students. An overview of interventions aimed to enhance TTM and their effect is given.

AB	In this paper, using my clinical work with a 3-year-old boy who lost his hearing when he was between 9 and 12 months old, and whose disability was only discovered when he was 22 months old, I will explore two issues of paramount technical importance when working with trauma. Firstly, it is crucial to create a boundary around the traumatic event, so that life before, during and after the trauma can be circumscribed and the traumatic event explored and hopefully understood and integrated. Secondly, it is of paramount importance to establish the level of developmental organization at the time of the trauma, especially in relation to the capacity to integrate bodily affects into mind. I will show how trauma and its vicissitudes are directly dependent on the person's capacity to resolve the splitting that trauma creates in the mind, and also the key role played by the use of metaphors in the process whereby trauma becomes thinkable and can therefore be integrated into the self.

AB	In this paper the author argues that trans-identification and its associated medical treatment can constitute an attempt to evade experiences of psychological distress. This occurs on three levels. Firstly, the trans person themselves may seek to evade dysregulated affects associated with such experiences as attachment trauma, childhood abuse, and ego-alien sexual feelings. Secondly, therapists may attempt to evade feelings, such as fear and hatred, evoked by engaging with these dysregulated affects. Thirdly, we, as a society, may wish to evade acknowledging the reality of such trauma, abuse and sexual distress by hypothesizing that trans-identification is a biological issue, best treated medically. The author argues that the quality of evidence supporting the biomedical approach is extremely poor. This puts young trans people at risk of receiving potentially damaging medical treatment they may later seek to reverse or come to regret, while their underlying psychological issues remain unaddressed.

AB	This paper aims to synthesize and identified several constraints of the research literature about whistleblowing and its impact on the organizations from the human resource and organizational behavior point of view. The importance of study concerning whistleblowing is an important trend in this today fraudulent world, however to our knowledge an integrative review in this sense is limited. By looking at the impact of whistleblowing act in collectivist culture, especially from the Asian perspective would give an impact to the development of the studies in the future. This review using an integrative review with the distribution of databases including Sciencedirect, EBSCO, JSTOR and soon using several terms including whistleblowing and collectivist of research published during 2003 to 2018. Thirty five papers were identified, analyzed, and capturing data of research located in several Asian countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand and Turkey. The findings of this review reveals that despite a positive trend of whistleblowing research in collectivist culture, the importance to increase human resource and organizational behavior aspects also lead to positive ethic climate in organization. Human resource and organizational behavior aspects to be found have a significance role in creating ethical culture in the organization.

AB	Our paper tests the hypothesis that living in limbo could have negative consequences for the socio-economic integration of refugees. We define limbo as a protracted period when asylum seekers are waiting for the decision concerning their permanent refugee status. Relying on the French survey of migrants, France's longitudinal survey of migrants (ELIPA), we measure integration by labour market participation, fluency in French, finding new French friends and studying. To account for the endogeneity of limbo, we instrument it with the administrative backlog. We find that living longer in limbo during the asylum-seeking period slows down future integration of refugees, but results differ with respect to gender and educational attainment. While having lived longer in limbo slows down most aspects of socio-economic integration for refugees with no degree or a high school degree, those with a bachelor's degree do not experience negative effects. Male refugees who had lived longer in limbo have a lower likelihood of being employed and studying in France, while similar females make fewer French friends.Resume Les limbes administratifs : couts economiques et sociaux pour les refugies. Notre article teste l'hypothese selon laquelle le temps passe dans les " limbes " pourrait avoir des consequences negatives sur l'integration socioeconomique des refugies. Nous definissons les " limbes " comme une periode prolongee pendant laquelle les demandeurs d'asile attendent la decision concernant leur statut de refugie permanent. En nous appuyant sur l'Enquete Longitudinale sur l'Integration des Primo-Arrivants (ELIPA), nous mesurons l'integration par la participation au marche du travail, la maitrise du francais, les liens amicaux avec des natifs francais et la poursuite des etudes en France. Pour tenir compte de l'endogeneite des " limbes ", nous l'instrumentons avec des indicateurs de la lenteur administrative. Nous constatons qu'une part plus elevee du temps passee dans les " limbes " durant la periode de demande d'asile ralentit la future integration des refugies, mais les resultats different selon le sexe et le niveau d'education. Alors qu'une plus longue duree des " limbes " ralentit la plupart des aspects de l'integration socioeconomique des refugies sans diplome ou avec un diplome d'etudes secondaires, les refugies avec un diplome superieur ne subissent pas d'effets negatifs. Les hommes etant restes longtemps dans les " limbes " ont beaucoup moins de chances d'etre employes et d'etudier en France, tandis que les femmes se font moins d'amis francais.

AB	The Summon Discovery tool is a widely used tool in academic libraries. This research explores how users interact with the Summon search interface in a laptop and mobile-simulation setting. The study was conducted using a combination of screen and audio recordings of the sessions, combined with real-time data recording of the participant's responses. The data was also checked against the recordings when there was ambiguity or uncertainty in the responses as they were recorded. Participants were given a set of five tasks and nine questions to complete, with there being multiple ways to complete each task. The Summon interface was changed to include links to additional resources. The results show that generally users preferred more information for the resources, as well as more links available in the navigation.

EA	OCT 2020
PY	2020
AB	Social media has potential to promote and support positive health behaviours. This systematic review explores the influence of social media on breastfeeding decision-making, promotion and support. For the purpose of the review, social media was defined as social networking sites and blogs; M-technology and apps were only considered if they included an interactive element, such as a 'share' function, or one-to-many communication. Searches were conducted on EBSCO across seven databases (limited to 2007-2019). Of the 1261 papers initially identified, 22 met the inclusion criteria for the current review. Results are mixed, but there is evidence that social media can be used to improve breastfeeding awareness and attitudes. Breastfeeding mothers value pro-breastfeeding online communities. However, the success of such social media groups may be dependent on specific content shared, individual contributors, and group dynamics. Key considerations for practitioners are offered regarding how social media can augment services offered to support breastfeeding. Research in this field is still very much in its infancy. Further investigation of specific social media content is needed, alongside the viewpoints of those who have ceased breastfeeding against their wishes.

TI	Innovative drivers for family business models in tourism
SO	JOURNAL OF FAMILY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
DI	10.1108/JFBM-05-2020-0043
EA	OCT 2020
PY	2020
AB	Purpose The aim of this paper is to verify whether, in the tourism sector, the "family business model" is an important development opportunity and, in particular, if it is an innovation driver for this industry development. In the literature, there is no conclusive evidence of this for the tourism sector. In this context, the authors investigate personal and family needs and preferences alongside the relationship between family business model, growth and profit maximization and the development of tourism businesses through innovation drivers. Design/methodology/approach To develop this topic, the authors conducted an extensive literature review considering the scientific papers published and contained mainly in database in the last 10 years (2010-2020) and focused the attention on the last five years. The authors ran content and structural analysis on the collected sources by main scientific databases (EBSCO, Scopus, Thomson Reuter, etc.). Based on a systematic literature review, the analysis was conducted using statistical criteria and bibliometric indicators. In detail, the authors used systematic literature review, bibliometric analysis and automatic text analysis (ATA) tools for identified lexicon analysis and strategic keywords and used statistical correlation to classify the different approaches in the literature and to outline the orientations of the various research groups. Findings From this analysis, the correlation between tourism, hospitality, entrepreneurship, life cycle and innovation dynamics was analysed. Important research gaps are identified, and future research priorities are suggested. Implications for both family business and tourism theory are discussed. Originality/value While the intersection between tourism management and family business model has been established in the literature, the number of related publications is still limited. Against this background, a literature review as a total analysis was an adequate and practicable research methodology. This paper proposes a comprehensive literature review and a reflection on the potential developments and applications for family business in the tourism sector. Authors also suggest several research directions that have not been adequately investigated yet. In particular, scholars do not seem to have caught all the implications of innovation adoption, especially for SMEs and family ownerships in tourism.

Method: a search was carried out in the EBSCO, ERIC, Scielo and Scopus databases, selecting articles published between January 2005 and March 2020, using the descriptors: physical education, curricular standards, standards-based assessment and educational level in Spanish and English. From the inclusion criteria, 9 articles were selected for their final review, taking into account the link with the descriptors and their interrelation. Results: as an outstanding finding, the importance of making a union between the evaluation criteria and the expected learning is highlighted, through the curricular standards. Conclusions: the curricular standards are a guide that provides greater clarity in educational practice, which must be followed by students and especially teachers. In addition, they allow a close link with evaluation criteria of educational practice, and a clear vision for teachers in favor of the expected learning of students, during and at the end of the course.

AB	In addition to all the medical-scientific characterizations, Covid-19 has been configuring an important field of significance and weighting of various logics of meaning that try to account for an intricate and complex semiosis, here defined as the pandemic, to systematize a indispensable means of interpretation of the enunciative dialectic of the present times. From this perspective, I have considered it convenient to outline the theoretical approaches of Gaston Bachelard with respect to the epistemological obstacle and thus to show the argumentation broadening with different views tending to cover elements that contribute to the argumentative strengthening of the unit of analysis. For this, Ontosemiotics is assumed as a theoretical-methodological approach to summon a series of variables around the enunciating subject and infer about the pathemic configuration as a clutch zone of the social, cultured, ideological and all those constituent elements of the semiosis of the pandemic that are part of the referential mainstreaming constituent of enunciative planes. Among the variables to refer to, the social confinement and domestic seclusion that they search for their opening sites on social networks stand out, although paradoxically they seem to constitute a great contemporary obituary that constantly stalks man between anguish and hope.

AB	For many years, researchers interested in the blogosphere have collectively acknowledged the lack of scholarly attention into the role of blog readers in the blogging activity. While many pioneering studies as well as new studies have highlighted the rising potential of this field, there has been no systematic examination of the growth or lack thereof of this field. As a result, this article reviews blog reader-focused research between 2008 and 2018 through a content analysis of blog reader-focused research articles obtained from seven databases: EBSCO's Academic Search Complete, JSTOR, EBSCO's Communication & Mass Media Complete, SAGE Journals, Elega's Chronological Arrangement of Blog Readership Research, Wiley Online Library, and Taylor and Francis. We also identified the methods, theories, geospatial concentration, and journals that published these articles. Findings show that although at least one article was published each year with a peak of six in 2013 and 2015, blog reader-focused research has not really evolved given that concentration has tremendously decreased in the last 3 years (2016-2018). Regarding genres, we learnt that the majority of articles focused on political blogs, and most of the studies adopted quantitative research methods and survey as a data collection method. The results also show that blog reader-focused studies published between 2008 and 2018 used Uses and Gratification Theory more than other theories, and the majority of these articles focused on blogs in the United States. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, New Media &Society, and Computers in Human Behavior published more blog reader-focused research than other journals.

AB	The purpose of this study was to examine the empirical studies on teacher burnout between 2000-2017. This study was designed as a systematic review examining 33 studies included in EBSCO, ERIC, SCOPUS and ULAKBIM databases and conducted in the Turkish context. The results revealed that a set of organizational and individual variables were associated with teacher burnout. The individual variables related to teacher burnout were self-efficacy beliefs, positive feelings and views, excessive control or suppression of feelings and views, a personality type prone to emotional imbalance, high level of external locus of control, having unrealistic expectations about education and school, monitoring teacher behaviours, and age. Organizational variables were job satisfaction, perceived administrative support, an environment of cooperation, support and trust, deviant student behaviours, and school climate. In this regard, the results of the study showed that teacher burnout was a construct associated with a set of both individual and organizational variables.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine quality assurance for archives and records management (ARM) education in an open distance e-learning (ODeL) environment in Eswatini with a view to conceptualise a framework for quality assurance in the development and implementation of an ARM programme in the context of ODeL. Design/methodology/approach The study is anchored on the interpretive research paradigm, which surrounds a systematic literature review. The researcher searched for literature online, using scientific databases such as Ebsco, Scopus and Google Scholar. The search applied the publications from 2005 to 2019. The main search keywords are "archives", "records management", "open distance e-learning" and "quality assurance". A total of 15 articles, which included documents, journal articles, reports, web pages and monographs, were retrieved, reviewed and analysed in this study. This conceptual study was preliminary, and the researcher hopes that further empirical studies based on the findings of this study could be pursued in future. Findings ARM as a form of study and delivered on ODeL platforms have been proposed in Eswatini. The major concern among stakeholders is how to ensure the quality of such programmes. Research limitations/implications This conceptual study was preliminary, and the researcher hopes that further empirical studies based on the findings of this study could be pursued in future. Practical implications The findings and recommendations will help in the development of ARM programmes to be offered effectively by way of ODeL, there is a need to develop a transparent quality assurance framework for such an application and its implementation. Originality/value This is the first study on quality assurance for ARM education in an ODeL environment in Eswatini. As part of the study, a quality assurance framework was designed for the implementation of ARM education on an ODeL platform. This quality assurance framework is intended to help higher education institutions in Eswatini such as the University of Eswatini as well as stakeholders such as the Eswatini National Archives and others to design ARM education and deliver it on an ODeL platform in a manner that guarantees adequate quality.

AB	This article is a literature review of mentoring and higher education academic literature from 2008-2018. The review analyzed what makes an effective mentor and what are the implications of practice for those strategies. This article is for higher education leaders, mentoring programs, and mentors who want to improve their traditional and online mentoring programs and mentoring practices. After narrowing the search terms, the researcher searched EBSCO and ERIC databases and this search produced a combined total of 256 results. These articles were further narrowed to 34 articles that met the keyword search and exclusion criteria. The remaining articles are the focus of the literature review analysis for mentoring and higher education literature. The review produced three major themes of impact of mentoring, role of mentor, and mentoring programs, as well as implications for practice for each theme. The researcher further examined the themes in detail and provided information about retention, persistence, long-term benefits of mentoring, student interaction, student support, role models, types of mentoring programs, platforms for mentoring, and mentor training. The review concludes with suggestions for further research, including recommendations for mentor training and online mentoring.

AB	Sustainable development has emerged by the raised awareness that natural resources consumption has led to ecosystem degradation and damaged populations' social conditions. Entrepreneurship has been included as an alternative for implementing sustainable development strategies hoping that a shift towards more sustainable products and services will stabilize the development model. The objective of this paper is to analyze the strengths and opportunities of sustainable entrepreneurship in Colombia. To that end, a document review was conducted, focusing on documents prepared in and/or related to the Colombian context. The Scielo, Dialnet plus, JSTOR, proposal, ScienceDirect, EBSCO Academic Search Ultimate, EBSCO Business Source Complete, Emerald Insight databases were consulted, and Colombian universities' domestic journals and repositories were reviewed. The review concluded that the Colombian entrepreneurship system did incorporate elements at the macro, medium, and micro levels, which constitute strengths while allowing the transition towards sustainability. Among those elements, there are paradigms, regulations, networks, public authorities, policies, and institutions that promote sustainable entrepreneurship and facilitate financing thereof, the niches where innovative ideas and projects, among others, are born. Regarding opportunities for improvement, methodological aspects in assessing business plans need adjusting to include social and environmental factors, and government entities need to provide more significant support and assistance to sustainable entrepreneurs.

AB	Violence in young couples is a serious problem that has drawn the attention of the international scientific community, which led to an increase in the number of studies carried out on the subject in Mexico. For this reason, this systematic review synthesizes the ethical and methodological aspects of studies on dating violence among Mexican youths published in the last two decades. In line with a Prisma protocol, a search was carried out in the Clarivate, Ebsco, Scielo and Scopus databases. Of the total 639 initial references, a total of 12 articles that met the inclusion criteria were analysed through a purification process that was divided into four phases (publication between 2000 and 2019, empirical articles, English or Spanish language, Mexican sample, age group between 17 and 35, and heterosexual couples). Among the main results, the predominance of the quantitative approach, non-experimental and cross-sectional designs, as well as the inclusion of non-probabilistic and non-representative samples were highlighted. Likewise, numerous inconsistencies were found in ethical aspects of psychological research.The results and the methodological implications are discussed, prioritizing the urgency for future studies to correct the mandatory ethical aspects in order to avoid bad practices or risks for the participants.

AB	Leaders play a critical role in the success or failure of their organizations. Leaders can be effective in implementing changes, building their organization's capabilities, and improving its performance, or the opposite, they could be ineffective. In this systematic review, the authors aim to summarize the findings of previous quantitative research, published between the period from 2000 to 2018, to identify the effect of various leadership styles on organizational Knowledge management (KM) capabilities and activities. The authors reviewed 50 articles found in well-known databases included Emerald, ScienceDirect, Taylor and Francis, Ebsco, Google Scholar, and others, concerning the impact of leadership when implementing KM in business organizations. The review revealed that transformational, transactional, knowledge-oriented leadership, top executives, and strategic leadership have evidence of their constant and positive effect on the KM process. The authors encourage organizations to use a combination of those styles to maximize the effect of leadership on KM. The authors also recommend conducting further studies on the effect of the remaining leadership styles, such as the ethical and servant leadership styles on KM and the other specific KM activities.

AB	Introduction. Academic libraries invest considerable resources in creating disciplinary subject guides, but patron use of such guides is rarely quantified in the literature. We analyse access data for subject guides and other electronic resource discovery tools to investigate disciplinary differences in resource discovery behaviour.Method. We analysed access data for resource discovery tools and subject guides that was collected over five weeks in the first term of the academic year at a public teaching and research university.Analysis. We analysed unique page views for subject guides, then calculated and compared access to electronic resources originating from the following resource discovery tools: Summon, subject guides, Google Scholar, and the database index.Results. Disciplines with high unique page views for subject guides were more likely to use subject guides or specific databases for resource discovery, while disciplines with low subject guide unique page views were more likely to use Summon or Google Scholar for resource discovery.Conclusions. The low unique page views for most guides suggests providing guides for all disciplines may not be an effective method for supporting students in resource discovery. This study also indicates a need for subject guide use to be evaluated in relation to other resource discovery tools.

AB	The advent of digital and networking technologies has begun to embrace the genesis of the next-generation digital archive. The inclusion of cross-domain objects like manuscript documents, audio and video recordings, photographs, paintings, sculptures and other digitised cultural heritage materials increases the complexity of digital archiving in terms of preservation, collection, and discovery of these resources. Introducing a high definition information retrieval system to exhibit the library and museum's digital resources to a maximum number of users in an open-access environment can satisfy the S. R. Ranganathan's fourth law - save the time of reader as well as the staffs. Nevertheless, from the perspective of acquiring an advanced OPAC view (web-scale discovery interface) with index-based searching, metadata harvesting, and accessing the physical as well as digital holdings is always a better option for Archival Collections Management System (ACMS). This paper illustrates the fundamental notions and applications of ArchivesSpace, a useful open-source digital archiving toolkit of the contemporary world and analyses its relevance in digital language archiving.

AB	Purpose The purpose of the current study is to identify the nature, scope and locus of and to systematize, the conceptual contradictions existing in dynamic capabilities research. Design/methodology/approach This paper employs a content analysis literature review of 86 papers on dynamic capabilities published between 1997 and 2019, using two databases - EBSCO and Web of Science/Knowledge databases. To structure the review, Smith and Lewis's (2011) categorization of organizational tensions is adopted. Findings First, the findings of this study suggest that DCs not only are shaped by a tension between efficiency and flexibility but also are built upon a large number of contradictory aspects, represented by organizing, performing, belonging and learning paradoxes. Second, the analysis identifies defensive and active responses to these tensions, with the former prevailing in the dynamic capabilities view literature. Both kinds of responses may facilitate or hinder organizational change. Third, it was found that while the literature has focused predominantly on organizing and learning paradoxes, the linkage between these categories remains under-researched. Originality/value This study makes three contributions. First, it identifies the scope (i.e. number), locus (analytical level) and nature (paradox categories and sub-categories) of DC-related paradoxes and responses to paradoxical tensions. Second, it shows that the nature and locus of conceptual contradictions are more complex than conceptualized in prior studies, going beyond the contingency and ambidexterity argument of how to deal with DC-related paradoxes. Third, it seeks to extend Di Stefanoet al.'s (2014) proposition of integrating paradoxical views on different DC-related aspects. The idea of "audio console" introduced in this study highlights the interrelation of paradoxes between the categories and across analytical levels.

AB	Purpose This paper puts forward a MARC-based semiautomated approach to extracting semantically rich subject facets from general and/or specialized controlled vocabularies for display in topic-oriented faceted catalog interfaces in a way that would better support users' exploratory search tasks. Design/methodology/approach Hierarchical faceted subject metadata is extracted from general and/or specialized controlled vocabularies by using standard client/server communication protocols. Rigorous facet analysis, classification and linguistic principles are applied on top of that to ensure faceting accuracy and consistency. Findings A shallow application of facet analysis and classification, together with poorly organized displays, is one of the major barriers to effective faceted navigation in library, archive and museum catalogs. Research limitations/implications This paper does not deal with Web-scale discovery services. Practical implications This paper offers suggestions that can be used by the technical services departments of libraries, archives and museums in designing and developing more powerful exploratory search interfaces. Originality/value This paper addresses the problem of deriving clearly delineated topical facets from existing metadata for display in a user-friendly, high-level topical overview that is meant to encourage a multidimensional exploration of local collections as well as "learning by browsing."

AB	The COVID-19 pandemic is not only a biological crisis but a psychological, sociocultural, economic, and spiritual one. Our most grave threat is not the coronavirus itself, but what we do in response. The understandable fear generated by the real dangers of this plague could reinforce a foundational confusion that recurrently brings suffering to us and all our relations: Namely, the dissociative fantasy that I am merely a separate, skin-bounded, autonomous, sovereign self. Fear and greed tend to follow this from this mistakenly contracted identity. Alternately, in fierce ways we would have never wished for, today's circumstances may be fostering a transformation of consciousness and culture. COVID-19 could subvert our supposedly separate self-sense, world-view, and way of being with others; disclose the "interrelated structure of reality" (as Dr. King put it); highlight the ethical implications that inherently come with it; and summon forth our loving, compassionate responsibility. Working with theoretical ideas and peoples' actual lived experience, the present article offers suggestions for collaboration-with and for all others-in this precarious time. Insights from humanistic, existential, phenomenological, and transpersonal psychology are set into dialogue with recent examples from daily life.

AB	Purpose Health care service is a widely researched area. Several established models and instruments measuring health care service quality (HCSQ) are available in the published academic literature. The objective of this article is to summarize this vast pool of available knowledge under the themes of HCSQ, its determinants and measurement strategies. Design/methodology/approach Sixty-three available published studies in peer reviewed journal combed in EBSCO and Google Scholar database have been examined and presented in exemplary literature review. Findings The findings have been segregated under the themes of HCSQ, its dimensions and determinants. It can be deduced from the findings that in spite of health care being a professional service, the user defined service quality takes center stage. Originality/value Rather than the seeker of care, the authors call for further research by taking a dyadic view of professional exchanges and including providers' perspectives of care in service quality evaluations as well.

AB	Significant cuts to the collections budget and a fire in the main library at Kansas State University transitioned the Libraries toward an increased focus upon electronic resources management. As electronic resource discovery continues to be hampered by market competition between Ex Libris and EBSCO library vendors, difficulties were identified in obtaining accurate usage statistics for resource renewal reviews, particularly EBSCO products. Kansas State University Libraries use the ALMA URM in combination with Primo discovery service, which experiences known resolver complications when paired with EBSCO resources. Technical services librarians and information technology staff tested several workarounds, but the question remains whether any proposed resolutions can be truly effective in avoiding collection usage biases and analytical discrepancies, resulting from exclusive indexing. Crunching the numbers, monetarily and analytically, the Ex Libris and EBSCO rivalry is an onerous battle on the budget and resource renewal process.

TI	Understanding interorganizational network evolution
SO	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING

EA	JUL 2020
PY	2020
AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the available insights regarding interorganizational network evolution. The research questions being addressed are as follows: What is the nature of interorganizational network evolution? And what causes interorganizational network evolution? The review hence focuses on the nature of interorganizational network evolution (at the ego-network level and whole-network level) and the causes of interorganizational network evolution (firm-related causes and environmental causes). This paper highlights relevant gaps in the existing literature on interorganizational network evolution while outlining a research agenda by identifying key research questions and issues requiring further scholarly contributions to stimulate research in this field. Design/methodology/approach An extensive review of scholarly peer-reviewed English language journal articles was conducted in the subject areas of economics, sociology, business and management (including entrepreneurship) while excluding articles in the domain areas of computer science that dealt with computer networks and the health field that addressed neural networks to obtain articles on interorganizational network evolution for the period 1970-2019. Various journal databases such as EBSCO, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Emerald, JSTOR and ABI/INFORM and Ebook Central on ProQuest were used to extract relevant articles using specific keywords. Findings To better understand this phenomenon of interorganizational network evolution, there is a need for future studies to focus on the less researched areas such as the "nature of evolution" of EINR1, EINR3 and EINR4 and the "causes of evolution" of FRC3, FRC5, FRC7 and FRC8. Further, over the years, in comparison to the evolution of interorganizational network relationships (EINR), fewer works have considered the evolution of overall interorganizational network structure (EINS). The research studies on environmental causes (EC) have been less in number in comparison to firm related causes (FRC), and this could be an area for further research. Also, studies on interorganizational network evolution have not examined the impact of FRC1 on EINR 3 and only a few studies have examined the impact of FRC1 on EINR1 and EINR4. Less attention has been given to the impact of FRC2 on EINR1, EINR3, EINR4 and EINS. Additionally, the impact of FRC3 on EINR1, EINR3 and EINS needs more in-depth examination. The impact of FRC4 on EINR4; FRC5 on EINR1, EINR2 and EINR4; FRC6 on EINR1 and EINS; and FRC7 and FRC8 on all forms of "nature of interorganizational network evolution" requires more research work. Finally, the impact of EC on EINR3 and EINR4 is also a less researched stream in the literature needing more scholarly contribution to better understand the phenomenon under consideration in this study. Some of the least explored theoretical lenses and relevant questions that can be addressed using these lenses to advance research on network evolution have also been discussed. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a comprehensive literature review, collating the dispersed knowledge on interorganizational network evolution - nature of evolution and causes of evolution, identifying areas that require further research attention for the development of this domain.

AB	The objective of the work reported was to show the transformations the research shows about the family and to identify if couples without children are considered as an emerging typology of family configuration. The importance of the relationship between the categories of family and a couple without children is that this is a time when a significant reduction in the birth rate can be seen worldwide. Furthermore, households made up of couples who state that they do not want to have children also represent a striking increase. On the other hand, this phenomenon has led to the emergence of research categories such as DINK, Childfree and NoMo families, which converge in the increase of couples without children and of women who do not wish to have children.From a documentary research under the modality of the state of the art, 35 articles were collected for this study between 1992 and 2017, which were analyzed from a hermeneutic perspective from the thematic nuclei "definition and transformation of the concept of 'family' and "Research perspectives on the relationship between childless couples and family". The search required the following categories in Spanish and English: "significado de familia/meaning of family", "definicion de familia/definition of family", "concepto de familia/family concept", "parejas sin hijos/couple without children/childfree/NoMo", "nuevas tipologias familiares/new family typologies", "familia DINK/DINK family" y "familia moderna/modern family". The databases taken into account for the study were Scopus, SciELO, Dialnet Plus, Psicodoc, EBSCO, DOAJ, Redalyc and Google Academic.Most research agrees that consanguinity and procreation are no longer essential criteria for forming a family, and thus, couples without children are constituted as a new family typology characterized by more equitable, consensual and democratic ways of making decisions. The main reason for this change is the new place that women have conquered in society after decades of struggle for their rights, favoring a questioning of the patriarchal system and the hegemonic model of the family called the nuclear family. The discussions about gender imaginaries that began with greater force in the 20th century, give a place to women in working life that, over time, has favored a questioning about the relationship between motherhood and being a woman.Research presents different criteria to define the family, which shows that this is a time when there is not one model but several family models. For its part, this diversity has been expressed not only in the dimension of social representations but also in the legal sphere; This is expressed this way, since several investigations in the field of law show transformations in Latin American constitutions by ways of understanding the family in a more plural way and based on fundamental rights.Finally, the collection of research shows that the study on the category of couples without children is incipient, that is, it corresponds to a phenomenon that, despite enjoying statistical evidence, can be considered emergent in culture insofar as its relevance corresponds to the last decades. Most studies that deal directly or indirectly with the category of childless couple, consider this form of bond as a form of family and explain how at this time this definition is mainly determined by affective criteria, values built between the members, and relational dynamics; leaving in the background the criteria of consanguinity or kinship from the nuclear model.

AB	The objective of the present investigation was to conduct a systematic review of empirical studies that have reported the use of identity fusion theory. The review followed guidelines and recommendations of the PRISMA statement. The following databases were used Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Willey Online Library, EBSCO and JSTORE databases. Empirical studies were selected, in Spanish and English that were published between 2009 and 2018. 52 articles were found that met the selection criteria. Most studies give evidence that identity fusion is a strong predictor of extreme sacrifice behaviors by the group. Likewise, identity fusion has generally been associated with variables such as: identification with the group, group commitment, perceived social support, loyalty even in ostracized conditions, feelings, affects and emotions towards the group, perception of kinship, among other. Its implications and limitations are discussed.

AB	Purpose Failure plays a pivotal role in entrepreneurial learning. Knowledge of the learning process that enables an entrepreneur to re-emerge stronger after a failure, though considerable, is fragmented. This paper systematically collects relevant literature, assigns it to the stages of the experiential learning process (concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, active experimentation; Kolb, 1984), evaluates the research coverage of each stage and identifies promising avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach This systematic literature review follows the guidelines articulated by Short (2009) and Tranfieldet al.(2003), using Web of Science and EBSCO as primary data sources. Kolb's (1984) experiential learning theory provides a basis for organizing the identified material into a framework of entrepreneurial learning from failure. Findings The literature provides insights on all stages of the process of entrepreneurial learning from failure. Particularly well elaborated are the nature of failure and its triggering effect for reflection, the factors influencing reflection, the contents of the resulting learning and their application in entrepreneurial re-emergence. Other topics remain under-researched, including alternative modes of recovery, the impact of personal attributes upon reflection, the cognitive processes underlying reflection, the transformation of failure-based observations into logically sound concepts and the application of this learning in non-entrepreneurial contexts. Originality/value This review provides the most complete overview of research into the process of entrepreneurial learning from failure. The systematic, theory-based mapping of this literature takes stock of current knowledge and proposes areas for future research.

AB	Purpose Given the interest in better understanding the economic effects of political connections, this paper aims to review empirical studies in the accounting and finance domain investigating the effects of firms' political connections on management's decision in non-US settings. Design/methodology/approach Key words used to search for relevant studies include "political connections" linked with "tax avoidance," "earnings quality" "voluntary disclosure." The authors consult several editorial sources including Elsevier, Electronic Journals Service EBSCO, Emerald, Springer, Palgrave Macmillan, Sage, Taylor & Francis and Wiley-Blackwell. The authors' search yields 46 published studies since 2006. Findings The review reveals a prevalence of studies conducted in Asia. A narrative synthesis of empirical findings shows mixed effects of political connections on earnings management, as measured by accrual-based or real earnings management practices. Mixed evidence also exists for the association between political connections and reporting policy (e.g. corporate social responsibility reporting). The review also reveals that firms with political ties adopt an aggressive tax policy aimed at reducing effective tax rates and are more likely to choose a Big 4 auditor. Originality/value The review discusses the political connections literature focusing on studies outside of the USA and the effect of such connections on decision-making by management. It identifies some limitations of this literature and offers guidance for future research avenues. The synthesis suggests that political connections can adversely or beneficially impact management's decisions depending on the legal, institutional and cultural characteristics prevailing in a particular setting.

A search in the database systems Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Scielo, based on eligibility criteria, resulted in 43 theoretical and 14 empirical works. The analysis of these studies showed the most significant empirical contributions, the most cited authors, methods, journals, and central themes addressed in studies onphronesisto understand ethics in business. From a virtue ethics perspective, we discuss the major theoretical and empirical contributions, as well as the implications of a restricted understanding ofphronesiswhen it is treated apart from other elements of the virtue ethics framework. We present a synthesis of the concepts ofphronesis, based on dimensions of magnitude and amplitude of the conceptions, ranging from formal to substantivephronesis, and covering individual, organizational, or societal levels of analysis. We argue that a substantive conception ofphronesiswithin virtue ethics may improve our understanding of ethics because it assumes the interdependence ofphronesisand moral virtues, integral anthropology, and the common good. We present a future research agenda, considering the study's limitations and findings.

AB	Purpose This paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners with an understanding of abusive supervision in the context of hospitality. It seeks to conduct a comprehensive review of the area and offer recommendations for future research by exploring the antecedents, consequences, mechanisms and designs of research on abusive supervision. Design/methodology/approach Content analysis was conducted to review and analyze studies on abusive supervision in the context of hospitality. Previous studies were searched in the EBSCO, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar electronic databases. Findings In total, 36 referred articles related to abusive supervision in hospitality were reviewed across four key areas, namely, antecedents, consequences, mechanisms and research design. After reviewing the research on abusive supervision in the context of hospitality, this paper offers future research directions with respect to research focus and research design. Research limitations/implications This paper only included English articles from peer-reviewed journals on abusive supervision. The number of reviewed articles was relatively small. This limitation may have arisen because abusive supervision is a new research field and is still a sensitive topic. Practical implications The results of this study may encourage managers to minimize or even halt abusive supervision. From an organizational perspective, formal policies may be developed to regularize supervisors' behavior. In turn, employees could use this paper to learn further about abusive behavior and how to handle it effectively. Social implications The review highlighted the negative consequences of abusive supervision. Managers should urgently realize the seriousness of abusive supervision and develop effective policies to minimize its negative effect. Originality/value This paper contributes to the emerging literature on abusive supervision in the context of hospitality by identifying key research trends and framing the outlines of empirical studies. It identifies research gaps, and as the first review of abusive supervision in hospitality, it may encourage researchers to explore the topic on the basis of the characteristics of the sector and offer suggestions for future research.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic review was developed in the Web of Science, Scopus and EBSCO databases, using the keywords: social innovation, social enterprise and management. After analysis of quality and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 54 articles were selected for full analysis. Findings SI process was systemised into four steps: mapping and development, consolidation, scaling up and evaluation. The drivers of SI were mapped and classified into three main factors: contextual, organisational and managerial. Practical implications In organisational factors, business model was emphasised, as well as partnerships, participatory culture and intrapreneurship, adequate levels of bricolage and continuous learning. The management factors included the characteristics of the entrepreneur/innovator and managerial practices, where those that facilitate teamwork and the participation of all involved are best suited. In contextual factors, the highlight was the need for support from policy makers; community participation and demand for innovations that consider local context and usability. Originality/value This study connects previously scattered knowledge in a generic model of SI, highlighting routines and processes used, and provides a starting point for innovators and social entrepreneurs in the complex, uncertain and often unknown process of SI. Additionally, several research gaps were identified to be addressed by future research in the context of SI management.

AB	Considering the increasing importance and presence of the Social Networks Sites (SNSs) in educational scenarios, this work is aimed at exploring the scientific literature on their educational use for the last years. Through a bibliometric analysis composed of 191 journal articles written in English and Spanish, found in 7 different databases (ERIC, Scopus, DOAJ, EBSCO, ISOC, REDIB, and PsycARTICLES), the following variables were analysed: database, academic journal, authorship (including number of authors, country, and institution), year of publication, Social Network Site involved, level of education, study population, and nature of the study. Results show the existence of a greater number of publications written in Spanish than in English as well as a higher interest in the topic from Spanish authors, academic journals, and institutions. Facebook and Twitter were ranked as the most popular SNSs in both English and Spanish articles. At the same time, the majority of the selected articles were focused on tertiary education and their students. Finally, Scopus was the one which hosted the largest amount of international literature (most of it framed by a qualitative research design). All in all, the scientific production analysed on the educational use of SNSs reveals a considerable, increasing, and developing interest in the present topic. Thus, several educational implications emerge with the introduction of digital scenarios, such as SNSs, in the educational environments.

AB	With the increasing need to minimize in-person contact as a way to stem the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the world, many clinicians are now providing mental health care exclusively through telepsychotherapy. Mental health mobile applications (MH apps) offer clients complementary therapeutic resources available outside of the telepsychotherapy session and have the potential to enhance the quality of care. However, not all mental health apps are created equal and clinicians lack guidance on how best to evaluate MH apps. This article discusses several ethical and practical considerations involved in using MH apps as an adjunct to telepsychotherapy, proposes recommendations for app evaluation, and provides a summary table of 28 popular English-language MH apps to assist clinicians in evaluating the manyMHapps available on the market today. The authors conducted a review of recent literature in EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) and included 10 peer reviewed, English language meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the efficacy of MH apps. The emerging literature suggests that the MH apps that have been studied in randomized control trials provide some benefit for targeted problems (e.g., depression) over waitlist control groups and under some circumstances are comparable to active intervention groups, although effect sizes tend to be small. However, of the 28 popular MH apps featured in this article, only 5 were found to have empirical support. Of note, few empirical studies reference any harmful effects, although risks have been posited.

AB	Drafting a systematic literature review on sustainable integration of supply chain and logistics is the main aim of this research paper, given the current needs expressed by academics, managers, and investors. Business sustainability, among all management tasks, heavily depends on successful integration between supply chain and logistics. Scholarly and academic double-blinded peer-reviewed journals, indexed in Scopus and EBSCO, are considered, in a time range between the years 2010 and 2019. Thus, summaries of journals are comprehensively assessed to appraise the integration between Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics in business markets. Through this work paper, the procedures behind an effective application of supply chain models are investigated in order to improve knowledge, in terms of recent advancements. The authors develop and carry out an effective business-case analysis, in which the application of Supply Chain Management and logistics procedures led to advancements in the field, therefore their systematic review will be beneficial in terms of a comprehensive current framework provision. According to the analyze explored by the authors, Decision Support Systems and computer frameworks really support business leaders in using Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics information and models, further providing specific training. The research paper observed that, indeed, a systematic review is an effective tool that encourages a thorough understanding of the key features related to the specific field. Despite limitations due to a small number of studies carried out on the specific topic, we strongly believe that this research will provide a great contribution to business management, towards an exhaustive, useful, and insightful analysis of the current studies on the integration between Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics applications.

AB	Jung understood dissociation as a natural state of the psyche, capable of turning defensive through development. Based on this premise, and its conception on the equivalence between psyche and matter, the present work describes the un-doing of a dissociation expressed through a chronic enterocolitis disorder. When the symbol remains closer to the body and its most instinctive manifestations, we need to descend to that level in order to let the vertical axis connection be gradually restored through the therapeutic relationship - the horizontal axis. In other words, this un-doing requires that patient and analyst follow the unconscious path proposed by symbolic expressions that gradually emerge through the patient's body and active imagination. Movement is our most primitive and fundamental experience. Many authors (Stern, Panksepp, Gallese) have agreed that, in addition to being first in terms of development, movement continues to have primacy over any other experience throughout life. This means that emotions, bodily concepts and, later, speech, evolve from a somatic basis. In the light of such neuroscientific findings, Jung's vision of the correspondence of psyche and matter will be revisited in order to portray how the analytic bond provides a context for the re-establishment of the linking/creative function of the archetype, and allows the restoring of the ego-Self axis connection by including non-verbal approaches, such as body-based active imagination, also known as Authentic Movement. Authentic Movement is an amplification of Jung's active imagination method that enables a dialogue between the ego and the diverse configurations of the unconscious. When such dialogue is grounded in the body, there is an easier access to the affective dimension stored in implicit memory. That which was relived through the body can gradually be remembered, and affects hitherto rejected, find other symbolic ways of being expressed and contained in the analytic vas.

AB	This paper explores the inevitable pain that integration requires in our individuation process. The unspeakable agony we defended against in order to survive we now experience consciously, including moments of going out of existence at the core of our madness. Clinical examples are given of these 'extinction points' and the abject helplessness analysand and analyst suffer in the face of this destructiveness. The first and second witness to this process (usually the analyst and the psyche itself) and the primordial creative life force are recognized in the process of recovery, a recovery that recoups the blessings of our finite human living.

AB	The gamified educational materials emphasize the interactive experience of the subject, its implication and autonomous decision-making in relation to the object of knowledge, information that it does not receive in a homogeneous and passive way, but that builds it through the personalized action of the game in a digitized environment. Gamification in higher education can provide to students better opportunities to develop commitment skills, increasing their motivation and making them more interested in what they are learning. The purpose of this review is to collect information, synthesize and integrate published works on the influence of gamification with the motivation and learning of students. With this, it is intended to establish the current state of knowledge on gamification in education, which will allow a better approach to future lines of research. Representative studies were identified through a systematic search in 4 databases: EBSCO SPORTDISCUS, SCOPUS, ISI and SCHOLAR GOOGLE, extracting data about the study design, participants, variables, instruments and results. We included 22 studies, 19 originals and 3 reviews of the literature. Initial evidence indicates that gamification in higher education motivates students and improves their learning, providing university students with better opportunities to develop commitment skills. The use of PBL (Points, Badges and Leaderboards) improves motivation and is considered as an adequate combination of mechanics in the implementation of any gamification process in higher education. Guidelines are indicated to maintain motivation and promote learning in the students.

AB	The significance of being an intellectual when taken prisoner and sent to a concentration camp by the Nazis is rarely discussed - instead, the importance of being either a Jew or a political prisoner (say, a German communist) is highlighted. By contrast, Jean Amery's recollections of being tortured and sent to Auschwitz concentrate on his self-understanding as an intellectual. What difference does the identity and outlook as an intellectual make in the extreme circumstances found in Auschwitz? The paper discusses Amery's views on this question, invoking that of others who have also addressed it, like Primo Levi and Theodor Adorno.

AB	Mindfulness-based training (MBT) has repeatedly been proven effective in improving mental health, as well as in eliciting advantages in executive functions (EFs), as demonstrated by objective measures. However, few studies have discussed the role MBT plays in increasing EFs over short periods of time. This current review, to our knowledge, is the first study to investigate the effect of short-term MBT on EFs. In this case, 14 studies were eventually included after literature screening using PubMed, MEDLINE, Elsevier, Embase, EBSCO and references from retrieved articles. We found that the relationship between short-term MBT and three main components of EFs were found controversial. Some reported that individuals' inhibition, working memory and attention shifting were significantly improved by short-term MBT, whereas others reported no such strong connections between MBT and EFs. These controversial findings result from the use of varied assessment instruments, cognitive tasks and experimental materials. Nonetheless, the findings from this review suggest short-term MBT could be of great value in improving mental health, which might especially enable the enhancement of individuals' inhibition and updating subfunctions of EFs. These practical evidences could have a strong impact on clinical psychology. However, the lack of consistency across the studies in this review indicated that more standardized and profound studies exploring the effects of short-term MBT on EFs are needed in the future.

AB	This manuscript addresses the internal logic of sparring taekwondo, regulated by the World Taekwondo Federation, to explain motor actions used in competitions. A narrative review was conducted on Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Ebsco, PubMed, ProQuest, and Dialnet databases, guided by structural and functional taekwondo parameters with no limits as to year of publication or language used. The authors describe the various elements that make up the sport's internal logic such as regulation, space, time, motor communication, roles and subroles in addition to the techniques or execution models that explain their special characteristics. This could assist in further examining the characteristics of that sport, defining combat actions, and contextualizing the real competitive situation by adapting tactical taekwondo sequences. Being aware of this sport's unique characteristics will enable creating the necessary framework to continue research on Olympic-level taekwondo.

AB	Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) promote citizens' participation in community life through several different kinds of organizations: some more informal (such as associations and volunteering groups), others more formal or public (such as charities and foundations). This heterogeneity, as well as the well-known peculiarities of NPOs when compared to profit and public ones, poses new challenges to their management. In the constant need to find balance between financial constraints and social value, a main resource for NPOs is the management of intangible assets, such as knowledge, positive relationships within the organization and with users, external image, loyalty and commitment, and so on. From the literature on for-profit organizations, it is well known that proper management of intangible assets improves an organization's sustainable competitive advantage, not only by enhancing its members' affiliation and commitment but even by enhancing their productivity. This is particularly relevant when taking into account the main role of volunteers in the third sector. Volunteers, indeed, show different job attitudes and organizational behaviors than paid employees, as their membership and accountability are less formalized and they frequently lack a proper teamwork, due to the high volunteer turnover. At the same time, from the managers point of view, managing volunteers and paid workers require higher skills and competencies than managing human resources in for-profit organizations. Developing these reflections and considerations, we aim to conduct a systematic literature review on the association between intangible assets and performance in NPOs. The literature will be conducted following the indications from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. It provides an evidence-based minimum set of items to be included in the review, as well as a workflow to properly manage and choose the papers to be included. The authors conducted the research using EBSCO, ProQuest, and Scopus databases.

AB	PurposeThis review aims to identify the determinants of voluntary disclosure of corporate social performance (CSP) and to analyze and consolidate previous quantitative studies to identify the theoretical perspectives and the variables used in measuring the determinants of CSP disclosure (CSP-D).Design/methodology/approachA literature review of articles published from 1987 to 2015 was conducted using the three databases, Ebsco, ISI and Jstor, with CSP-D as the dependent variable. The goal was to identify the theoretical perspectives underlying the studies and the independent variables.FindingsThe literature revealed a set of variables and their general measures, but the consensus confirmed that there was no single explanation for what determined CSP-D. The published theories that support a relationship between CSP-D and its determinants are legitimacy, institutional, stakeholder, agency and voluntary disclosure theory.Originality/valueThe results allowed us to identify the perspectives underlying the major theories and disclosed a set of factors considered by the literature as the ones that influence CSP-D. This information will be useful for researchers interested in developing their own studies on CSP-D because it presents the evolution of CSP-D factors over time and organizes the findings of multiple studies developed since the emergence of the theme.

AB	Objective of the study: the objective of this study was to investigate measures and scales of attitude related to sports sponsorship found in the international literature.Methodology/approach: this is an exploratory and descriptive bibliographic search. Based on a bibliographic search carried out on the basis of Ebsco, with the configuration (attitud*) AND (sport*) AND (sponsor*), and after filtering, seventeen studies on the subject in question were analyzed.Originality/Relevance: the study differs from others mainly because of its specific focus of analysis. Thus, it does not focus on methods, results or conclusions of the studies analyzed, but otherwise, it specifically analyzes the measures and scales used to achieve the objectives of the respective investigations.Main results: from the analysis of the measures and scales, it was possible to point out indicators commonly used to investigate the attitude regarding sports sponsorship, highlighting: the intentions to purchase the sponsor's products; the perception of synergy between the sponsored activity and the sponsor; the degree of involvement with the sponsored activity; intention of recommendation of the sponsor (mouth to mouth); and the recognition of the sponsoring brand.Theoretical/methodological contributions: the study contributes to the field of knowledge by bringing details about measures and scales of attitude related to sports sponsorship and identifying the main indicators used.Social/management contributions: it contributes to management by enabling the visualization of a broad overview of the different forms of the construct - attitude towards sports sponsorship - to be measured, thus expanding its understanding and, possibly, its use.

AB	Introduction: Low birth weight (LBW) is an important general health indicator. The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of LBW in Iran.Method: This meta-analysis was reported based on the PRISMA guidelines. All stages were independently performed by two authors. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020163446). We searched epidemiological studies at international databases of Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar search engine, as well as Iranian databases of SID, IranDoc, Iranian National Library, Barakat Knowledge Network System, RICST and Magiran using MeSH keywords without time limit until 2019. After selecting the studies, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, data extraction and qualitative assessment, the data were analyzed based on random effects model using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software version 2. P < 0.05 was considered significant.Results: The prevalence of LBW in Iran was 7.95% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.36-8.58) in 62 studies with a sample size of 301,839 newborns. The prevalence of LBW in girls and boys was 8.41% (95%CI: 7.47-9.45) and 6.67% (95%CI: 5.86-7.59), respectively. The girls-to-boys odds ratio of LBW was 1.25 (95%CI: 1.13-1.39, P < 0.001) very LBW and extremely LBW prevalence was estimated to be 0.61% (95%CI: 0.40-0.93) and 0.29% (95% CI: 0.18-0.45), respectively. The risk factors for LBW were age of >35 versus [vs.] <= 35 (P = 0.024), age of <18 vs. >= 18 (P < 0.001), education of middle school and lower vs. high school and higher (P < 0.001), weight under 50 kg (P = 0.001), employed vs. housekeeper (P < 0.001), inadequate prenatal care (P = 0.046), interval with previous pregnancy <2 vs. >2 (P < 0.001), prematurity (P < 0.001), history of LBW (P < 0.001), multiple birth (P < 0.001), abortion (P < 0.001), vaginal bleeding (P < 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.001) and preeclampsia (P < 0.001).Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis showed that LBW is prevalent in Iran. This study can be a national database for LBW that would be of interest to Iranian health policy-makers and planners.

AB	This study examined the effectiveness of psychological interventions for severe health anxiety (SHA) regarding somatic symptoms (SS) and health anxiety (HA). The databases Web of Science, EBSCO, and CENTRAL were searched on May 15, 2019, May 16, 2019, and August 5, 2019, respectively. Eighteen randomized controlled trials (N = 2,050) met the inclusion criteria (i.e., hypochondriasis, illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder with elevated HA being assessed with validated interviews: use of standardized outcome measures). Two reviewers independently evaluated the studies' risk of bias using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for randomized trials (RoB-2) tool. Overall, psychological interventions were significantly more effective than waitlist, treatment-as-usual, or placebo post-treatment (g(SS) = 0.70, g(HA) = 1.11) and at follow-up (g(SS) = 0.33, g(HA)= 0.70). CBT outperformed other psychological interventions or pharmacotherapy for HA post- treatment (Hedge's g(HA) = 0.81). The number of sessions did not significantly predict the effect sizes. In sum, psychological interventions were effective for SHA, but the generalizability of the results for SS is limited, because only two high-quatity trials contributed to the comparison.

AB	PurposeAs sharing economy has become increasingly popular, researchers from various disciplines begin to pay more attention to this important phenomenon. However, the current literature is fragmented and lacks a framework to integrate previous studies and guide future research. This study aims to systematically review the literature to better understand what one knows and what one need to know about sharing economy and provide a road map for future research in the context of sharing economy.Design/methodology/approachA systematic review was conducted with EBSCO and science direct database. In total, 91 studies were identified.FindingsThe review shows that previous studies focus on different stakeholders, including consumers, peer service providers, platform providers, and competitors. The authors further identify the main topics and limitations of the literature (integrated into a framework) and provide possible directions for future studies. For example, the authors find that few studies have examined individual and technical factors. The findings also show that consumers' other activities and outcomes have received little attention. To address these limitations, future studies that examine how individual and technical characteristics influence sharing economy's usage intention/behaviors are suggested. The authors also suggest future studies to explore other activities during the process of sharing economy services.Research limitations/implicationsThe framework and directions provided can further the sharing economy research by addressing important gaps in the current literature.Originality/valueThis review identifies many opportunities for researchers to better understand the phenomenon of sharing economy.

AB	The aim of this note is to understand how content relating to marketing and market research is distributed to and within universities. The focus of the study includes the behavior of all those in this market for information, namely suppliers (whether content generators, aggregators, packagers, or distributors of content) of marketing research, university staff, and students. The case study method was implemented to collect data. The case study focuses on UK Higher Education. Specifically, the authors use the case study of the newly developed Archive of Market and Social Research (AMSR) to explore how content relating to marketing and market research is distributed to and within universities. The research involved personal interviews with 15 librarian senior managers selected from 14 universities. The interviews with librarians provided insight into how AMSR could be distributed to university libraries and how it could be accessed. The findings highlight the role of university academics in specifying the content of marketing and market research. They focus on 'real world' management problems to deliver research with impact and relevant teaching. Therefore, they need company and industry information and are more likely to use current sources. The study maps the process of acquisition of marketing and market research content by universities and identifies the different roles involved in this process. The study is in line with the emerging literature that focuses on the role of education in explaining the relevance gap in marketing research. The study contrasts between the situation in the university market and industrial buying and adds to our understanding of the complexities associated with the distribution of the marketing research material. The result is expected to be a much sharper focus for the marketing of the archive material, leading to greater use of recent high-quality market research by marketing educators, and changes to marketing and market research syllabuses. This note provides insight into how suppliers (whether content generators, aggregators, packagers, or distributors of content) of market and marketing research should market to universities and ensure the use of their information resources by students and teachers and how they should. The findings of the study contribute to understanding customer needs and shaping a new service product proposition. In addition, the study provides insight into how university students and staff access and should access commercial research on marketing from the market research industry (in particular from the Archive of Market and Social Research) and use it in their learning, so that their knowledge will be more up to date and their employability will be increased. Adding several insights to the issue of distribution of marketing research material to universities. The paper relates to the marketing of information resources to universities, specifically to the work of the Archive of Market and Social Research, in marketing their information assets to universities, and more specifically the relationship between the "push" of suppliers, libraries, journal and textbook suppliers and information aggregators (such as EBSCO and JISC) and the pull coming from academic researchers and lecturers, who might use this information in their teaching and research. The present study can be seen as a classic case study of understanding buyer behavior, but in a modern world of information platforms, aggregation, and the digital economy.

AB	Cloud robotics is a field of robotics that endeavors to summon cloud advances, for instance, cloud computing, and other internet advances focused on the advantages of merged framework and shared administrations for robotics. In this research, an intelligent task planning mechanism is proposed to attain a certain level of attention for knowledge sharing among cloud-based robots using mamdani fuzzy inference system (MFIS). The proposed task planning mechanism using mamdani fuzzy inference system (TPM-MFIS), can classify the different stages of attention such as very high, high, medium, low, very low and none. In this recommended intelligent system, cloud robotics services are used to maintain the workload of each robot. Whereas, all fuzzification and decision-making policies handled on cloud to avoid the redundancy task planning consumption on individual level. This system has two input variables that are facial expression and motion rate. Input variables detect the output level of attention to be very high, high, medium, low, very low, and none. This paper presents an analysis of the result's accuracy using proposed TPM-MFIS to model the task planning process.

TI	Can database-level MEDLINE exclusion filters in Embase and CINAHL be used to remove duplicate records without loss of relevant studies in systematic reviews? An exploratory study

AB	Objective: To investigate whether using database filters to remove MEDLINE results within Embase (OVID) and CINAHL (EBSCO) would result in fewer duplicate records, without leading to any loss of studies included in the final review.Methods: We reviewed the included studies from a sample set of 20 Cochrane Reviews published in 2015-2018, and replicated the search strategies from those reviews in MEDLINE, EMBASE (both on the OVID platform) and CINAHL (EBSCO). Results were exported to EndNote; then relevant MEDLINE filters were applied within CINAHL and Embase, and results were exported again. Filtered results were analysed to determine whether the filtered EMBASE and CINAHL results excluded studies that were not identified in the original MEDLINE search. Results: Using the "Records from: Embase" filter resulted in no loss of included studies; however, the "Exclude MEDLINE journals" filter in Embase resulted in a failure to retrieve a large number of relevant studies. CINAHL's filter for MEDLINE records resulted in a small number of studies being lost. Conclusions: The "Records from: Embase" filter may be safely used for deduplication, though as it removes conferences, searchers may also want to review Conference abstracts separately using the Conferences filter. CINAHL's MEDLINE filter comes with a small risk of filtering out relevant studies, but may be appropriate to use. Although we did not set out to address this issue, our results demonstrate that searches of MEDLINE are still necessary, as not all relevant results were found in Embase alone in order to identify all relevant studies.

AB	This study applies the method of paratextual analysis to six electronic books, or ebooks, in an academic library collection at a small liberal arts college. Two books are selected from each of three platforms: ebrary, EBSCO, and SpringerLink. The characteristics of each book are described, including design and readership, as well as 2 years of usage statistics from the specific library, and altmetrics where available. The paratextual study leads to a closer investigation of the usage statistics themselves and concludes that despite industry standards, they are not calculated consistently across vendor platforms and that while these data are invisible to researchers outside of the library, there are also essential elements that librarians mistakenly take at face value when comparing ebook usage from multiple vendors.

AB	Jung's study centres on the amplification of pictures painted by a woman patient and posits their sequence as evincing the initial stages of the individuation process. His text performs a dialogue with its audience whereby Jung persuades us of this truth, and also reveals Jung's dialogue with his patient and with his own ideas. The present paper revisits the clinical material first with a focus on the interaction between Jung and his patient. The second part compares the 1940 and 1950 versions of Jung's study with attention to tensions that traverse them, such as Jung's attitude to the animus and his two voices as a practitioner and a theorist.

AB	After migrating to Ex Libris's Alma and Primo for its integrated library system (ILS) and discovery layer, library staff at Simon Fraser University (SFU) maintained duplicate database information in a locally developed electronic resources management (ERM) system known as the CUFTS ERM for fifteen months. The CUFTS ERM provided the data for the library's public-facing database list known as the CUFTS resource database (CRDB). A database search function had been on Ex Libris's Primo roadmap for product development and was announced six months after the library went live with Alma and Primo. However, the new Primo database search function lacked the ability to replace the CRDB. Members of the library's ILS Steering Committee who managed Alma and Primo were concerned about significant negative impacts on end-users if the library adopted Primo to replace the CRDB. The steering committee formed a task group to investigate options for creating a database list from Alma records to reduce duplication of staff time and effort, and systems resources, and to replicate the main functions of the existing CRDB for end-user discovery and access.

AB	Computer science concepts have an important part in other subjects and thinking computationally is being recognized as an important skill for everyone, which leads to the increasing interest in developing computational thinking (CT) as early as at the comprehensive school level. Therefore, research is needed to have a common understanding of CT skills and develop a model to describe the dimensions of CT. Through a systematic literature review, using the EBSCO Discovery Service and the ACM Digital Library search, this paper presents an overview of the dimensions of CT defined in scientific papers. A model for developing CT skills in three stages is proposed: i) defining the problem, ii) solving the problem, and iii) analyzing the solution. Those three stages consist of ten CT skills: problem formulation, abstraction, problem reformulation, decomposition, data collection and analysis, algorithmic design, parallelization and iteration, automation, generalization, and evaluation.

AB	After instituting major cuts to discipline-specific science abstracting and indexing (A&I) databases at an ARL library due to significant budget cuts, the author sought to determine if such cuts were being made by other academic libraries and what trends could be found in holdings of such databases. Annually, over the course of eight years, 108 ARL libraries and 74 Oberlin Group library website A-Z database lists were reviewed to look for the presence of 21 Science and Technology A&I databases. Additions and cancellations were recorded and verified. The results indicate little change in the holdings of several discipline-specific databases including MathsciNet, SciFinder Scholar, and GeoRef, while there were declines in holdings of several other databases including INSPEC, Biological Abstracts, and Compendex. Also measured were holdings of Proquest and EBSCO science A&I databases, which saw small declines in holdings, as well as holdings of comprehensive A&I databases Scopus and Web of Science, which saw a significant increase for Scopus holdings.

AB	It is undeniable that the Agile software development (SD) framework has been commonly used in information technology projects. However, many of the early adopters failed to implement it properly. Some researchers had proposed a solution by using the adaptation framework as a support, but they cannot clearly explain its development. Furthermore, the correlation between adaptation framework and problem solving is dubious. This study reviews and discusses the literature and empirical studies on the failure of Agile SD implementation by revisiting the supporting framework that used to comprehend the issues in Agile SD implementation. A comparative approach is used to review the literature available in academic databases, such as ProQuest, EBSCO, IEEE, and Scopus, to ensure research originality and novelty. By filtering 87 papers that met the initial criteria, only 4 researchers focused on the area of knowledge management and used the learning process as a supporting framework in Agile SD implementation. However, they did not clearly explain the development of the framework for Agile SD. The author's initial research on a corporation reveals the failure of Agile SD implementation. Soft systems methodology (SSM)-based action research (AR) proposed to identify the real issues in Agile SD implementation. SSM-based AR provides a solution by clarifying the development of a framework using tacit and explicit knowledge to validate the development process. This study can help practitioners and academics understand the process of Agile SD implementation by early adopters who still need assistance with its application. This study is the first to explore Agile SD implementation in a corporation using the experience-based approach, contributing to knowledge improvement. It contributes to the scholarly literature by presenting concepts that combine human-centric aspects and knowledge management to improve the learning in the organization.

To become more familiar with accessibility efforts at other colleges and universities, the authors compiled a brief literature review that discusses state statutes for accessibility, university policies on accessibility, and librarians' audits on web accessibility and vendor supplied databases. To determine the accessibility of the library's subscribed tools and services, the director of the office of institutional research & training and the director of the library, archives, and learning center used the WAVE online accessibility checker to audit the main library electronic resources: Gale Power Search, ProQuest, Yewno, EBSCO, LibGuides, SpringShare A-Z Database List, JSTOR, Adam Matthew, SAGE Research Methods, and Encyclopedia Britannica. WAVE results indicate that there are errors with 9 out of 10 electronic resources reviewed and alerts with 10 out of 10 of the audited electronic resources.

AB	Global economy and era of digitalization poses great pressure on development of different enterprises. Businesses have to be complied with newest technologies and focus on efficiency of their management system. Seaports are complicated business systems, which are becoming global hubs for different stakeholders to exchange data within complex infrastructure. Digitalization of such complex systems requires a coherent approach, aiming to summon managerial and digitalization goals. The key concept to create a digital-based system of business processes is the concept of IT-services, which are characterized to be a support of business functions. The goals of this research paper is to adapt standard of Enterprise Architecture and create a coherent system of business processes for container terminals and suggest a set of IT-services, which could be further transformed into a complex Applications Architecture of seaport. This Applications Architecture can be further built up with modern digital technologies and information systems of different types.

AB	Critical thinking, while often used as a mere buzzword, is clearly relevant to the mission and expertise of librarians who teach. Even in online information literacy instruction, critical thinking remains an important goal. This study attempts to determine the ways and extent to which online information literacy learning objects follow best practices for teaching and assessing critical thinking. In this study, the researcher evaluated a sample of information literacy online learning objects in the Association of College and Research Libraries repository of peer-reviewed instruction materials, PRIMO, using a literature-based rubric. The resulting analysis provides evidence of the extent to which information literacy online learning objects adhere to best practices for teaching and assessing critical thinking.

Academic Onefile, Academic Search Complete (EBSCO), Dialnet, EBSCOhost (MedicLatina and Medline) Scopus and Springer databases were selected to find articles published between 2005 and 2020. The final sample was 14 articles. On average, the prevalence of pathological gambling was 5.32% (SD = 2.12). All research concluded that pathological gambling and alcohol use are problems with a low intensity positive correlation. This relationship is more intense among men than women, although only two studies (14.28%) provided evidence in this regard. Our findings may help to describe the state of the art in this phenomenon and, thus, create awareness of its magnitude among the population.

It aims to investigate these effects by means of a bibliographic research, with a qualitative approach and exploratory and descriptive nature. It presents a brief explanation about cyberculture, information society and the presence of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Internet in educational scenarios, considering the ponderations of authors as Castells (2003), Levy (2010), Primo, Valiati, Lupinacci and Barros (2017), Santaella (2013), among others. It discusses data about schools' structure in terms of ICT and Internet availability, Internet connection, teacher's formation to use digital technologies in the teaching and learning process, use of ICT and Internet by students, etc It highlights the advances and limitations of Brazilian schools towards the integration of technologies for learning. It recognizes that Brazilian public schools are the most limited in this context, especially those that work with the elementary level. It observes that students are every day more connected to the Internet through mobile technologies and, therefore, they could be better explored for educational purposes. It notes that, in general, the North and Northeast regions are those with more struggles to integrate ICT in pedagogical practices.

AB	Ave Maria Schools were founded in Granada in 1889 by the priest and educator Andres Manjon. Unlike the traditional method of infant education in those years, Father Manion centered pedagogy in the Catholic religion, considering nature as God's work. In his concept, play, manual labor and outdoor teaching were good Christians in a happy environment so that they would later join the working world. They quickly spread throughout Spain and other countries, Ave Maria Schools are considered a pioneering experience of teaching in their time and enjoyed great social prestige.In the subsoil of Almaden, the largest mercury deposit in the world was exploited from the Arab domination, with 2,500 workers working in the first half of the 20th century. The School of Children of Workers had been founded in 1908, but in 1926, coinciding with the proclamation of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, it was transformed into a Manjonian school. Become a secular school during the Second Republic and the subsequent civil war, he returned to act as a school of Ave Maria from 1939 until the 1960s. Minas de Almaden, like other large mining and industrial companies in northern Spain, exercised a paternalistic strategy with its operators and chose religious education as the most appropriate for the formation of their children.

AB	In the field of education, commonly illuminated by the prism of recognition and representation, to activate the mode of thought of Gillles Deleuze and summon him as a research company is to drop an effervescent pill into a glass of water. The Liquid changes, the molecules agitate; there is movement, noise, noise, excitement, enthusiasm, tumult, transformation. This is because in the context of teaching, which is ruled by the Platonic matrix, the ideas of the philosopher are a disturbance. An euphoria. His propositions challenge the way of thinking, taking off the security of processes, without safeguarding nothing, and breaking established and consecrated boundaries. In this scenario, the purpose of this article is to present some boiling points of Giles DeLeuze's way of thinking, through propositions of the philosopher himself From these, connections are armed with other authors and with the Literature. These are Antonio Candido and Marcel Proust. In this way, the intention is to rehearse possibilities with education and, at the same time, to shed Light on the radicality that exists in Deleuzian philosophy.

AB	The objective of this article is to review the existing historiography on the Escuelas de Barriada (Rural Schools of Bizkaia Province, Basque Country), created and promoted by the Provincial Council of Bizkaia between 1920-1937, giving nuance to certain issues and providing new data on four aspects. The first of these is the question of instructional language. The use of Basque in the classroom was progressively reduced in favor of Spanish almost from the first moment and did not provoke opposition from teachers, even though many of them were Basque nationalists. Secondly, we provide an analysis of the initial curriculum, which presented a more pedagogical rather than ideological approach, oriented towards a teaching style that was more comprehensive than memory-based. This was especially appreciable in the areas of mathematics and geometry, where exclusionary political indoctrination was avoided, with content referring to both Basque and Spanish identity. Thirdly, we analyse the alleged use of books containing Basque nationalist political content in these schools, of which we have found no evidence. And finally, we offer an overview of the type of teachers that worked in these schools, including an analysis of their ideological profile: more than 90% of the faculty was composed of women, generally young, single, Basque-speaking, Catholic and ideologically sympathetic to Basque nationalism . The research focuses on the 1920-1930 period, when the Provincial Council of Bizkaia was governed by Monarchists and when the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera began. This was the period when the original pro-Basque project of these schools was transformed. Some data and questions about the later era are also presented.

AB	In his memoirs as an Auschwitz survivor, Primo Levi developed the concept of grey zone to explain the different ways in which the Nazi regime led its Jewish enemy to a process of self-destruction by diffusing the line between victim and executioner. In the aftermath of Auschwitz, this concept quickly spread beyond the limits of the camp and promptly became a necessary piece for the understanding of what happened during the Holocaust, above all due to the accuracy of a concept, grey zone, that still interact with the present. Seventy-five years after the Second World War finished, cinema is one key actor in the preservation of the debate on the Holocaust thanks to the strength of its images. Recent different films on this subject evidence the importance of remembering what happened then so that the memory of the Jewish genocide could be maintained, especially when the survivors are fewer. In this sense, the aim of this article is to study how that concept of grey area developed by Levi -and its different contemporary interpretations- is manifested in today's cinema, in order to understand the importance of the term and how it has been potentially nourishing a new ethics and aesthetics.

AB	Objective - To examine the relationship between student search behaviours and the quality of scholarly sources chosen from among library search tools.Design - Unmonitored search sessions in a facilitated library setting.Setting - A mid-sized public university in the United States of America.Subjects - 50 upper-level undergraduate students in the social and behavioural sciences.Methods - Recruited participants were given one of two search prompts and asked to use EBSCO's Social Science Abstracts and two configurations of ProQuest's Summon, with one being pre-scoped to exclude newspapers and include subject areas within the social sciences. The search tools were assigned in random order. In each case, the participant was asked to find two of the "best quality" articles (p. 3). A librarian was present in the room but did not observe participants; instead, all sessions were recorded using Camtasia Relay. Afterwards, participants were interviewed about the process they used and their impressions of the search tools. They also completed a survey collecting information on their GPA and whether they had previously had library instruction.Main Results - Facet use differed significantly between the EBSCO database and Summon, though not between the two different configurations of Summon. There was a significant relationship between high use of facets in one platform being connected to high use in the other platforms. In contrast to some previous studies, a non-trivial proportion of participants went beyond the first page of search results. In support of most previous studies, participants infrequently searched on the subject field or changed the default sort order. Summon's article suggestion feature was noted as being especially helpful, and clicking on suggested articles was significantly correlated with the number of article records viewed.Conclusion - The choice of search tool has a large influence on students' subsequent search behaviour. Many of the advanced features are still missed by students, although in this study the majority of sources picked were of high quality. The authors note the importance of configuring the interface so that facets and other features deemed worthwhile by librarians are higher up on the page. The researchers reason that the prominent display of facets leads to greater uptake. Despite finding no association between library instruction and facet use, teaching students how to use facets remains an advisable strategy.

AB	The Falange of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and the Franco regime imported from other countries several institutions, among them, the Labour Universities (1955-1983). Jose Antonio Giron was the founder, although to create them he followed the Belgian Labor University (1911) created by Paul Pastur. In this paper, we will analyze the similarities and differences between both institutions through the information that NO-DO (Noticiarios-Documentales) (Newsreels and Documentaries, audiovisual propaganda of Franco's regime) offered in its newsreels about the Spanish Labour Universities. Both institutions were similar in the architecture, in the design of spaces, and in offering different specialties, mainly in the industrial field. They differed in the context in which they were born. The Belgian Labor University was also imported into other countries such as France, Zaire, Montevideo, Iran and China.

AB	The ability of Industry 4.0 to help solve complex economic and social problems and implement complex concepts is assessed. Currently, one of the greatest challenges is the integration of the circular economy (CE) into real business practices. However, the link between these two ideas is not fully recognised, causing an interpretative dilemma. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify the relationships between the CE and Industry 4.0. For this purpose, we performed a systematic literature review and content analysis of selected articles indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO. In total, 32 papers published during the period 2017-2020 were analysed. The findings show a one-way relationship, i.e., Industry 4.0 leads to a CE, and a two-way relationship, indicating synergy between these concepts. The key spheres of the CE in terms of Industry 4.0 are the recycle and reuse strategy applied in smart production and a sustainable supply chain. This study demonstrates the importance of company (micro) and industry (meso) levels as application areas. The most promising digitalisation tools of Industry 4.0 are the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics. The article concludes with the limitations of the study and a formulation of directions for future research.

AB	In the frame of the first phase of the research titled "Resilience in Victims of Domestic and Gender Based Violence", carried out by the Psychology academic program at the Santo Tomas University (Bogota, Colombia), a literature review was carried out which described the State of the Art of studies published between 2015 and 2019 regarding Family Resilience against Domestic and Gender-based Violence. There were preliminary results gathered from 3160 documents, which were later reduced to 74 articles according to the following criteria: original articles, rational thinking, literature review, and qualitative data, quantitative data, or mixed methods research published between 2015 and 2019. The research was carried out using the following Databases: PubMed, Ebsco Host, Science Direct, Scopus, PsyINFO, sage, Sprinter, and Taylor & Francis. A particular trend has been identified as a result of the research, with a large set of studies using mostly applied, qualitative and descriptive data of female, child and teenager participants who have reported cases of domestic violence, conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. However, it was observed that the literature makes indirect reference to family resilience, since for the most part it refers to coping mechanisms, recovery, and protective factors as phenomena of interest related to Domestic and Gender-based Violence. It is concluded that there are still very few studies which, while describing the emergence of family resilience and intervention alternatives for its development, explicitly include a gender approach or gender-related elements in cases of domestic violence.

AB	When selecting a web analytics tool, academic libraries have traditionally turned to Google Analytics for data collection to gain insights into the usage of their web properties. As the valuable field of data analytics continues to grow, concerns about user privacy rise as well, especially when discussing a technology giant like Google. In this article, the authors explore the feasibility of using Matomo, a free and open-source software application, for web analytics in their library's discovery layer. Matomo is a web analytics platform designed around user-privacy assurances. This article details the installation process, makes comparisons between Matomo and Google Analytics, and describes how an open-source analytics platform works within a library-specific application, EBSCO's Discovery Service.

AB	The developing world has become the primary destination for used electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) exported by the developed world, making e-waste management critical. This paper aims to determine the state of e-waste management in Sub-Saharan Africa by critically reviewing the corpus on electronic waste (e-waste) management in the region. Even though many studies were conducted on e-waste management, very few are conducted on developing countries who are significant recipients of used EEE. We applied a systematic literature review (SLR) process on research articles retrieved from Web of Science, EBSCO Host and Sabinet databases. Using the keywords that included e-waste management or recycling or policy in Sub-Saharan Africa or Africa, we searched for articles from these databases. We analysed 25 papers selected from 151,558 papers initially retrieved to answer the research questions. The findings revealed that about 80% of research on e-waste management in the Sub-Saharan Africa region was undertaken in three countries: Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa. The review of the selected articles revealed that lack of policy and limited recycling infrastructure were the main barriers to effective e-waste management. The SLR revealed that most countries in the region practice informal and rudimentary recycling methods. Based on the common barriers identified, our recommendations can provide insight to policymakers, contribute to theory, and offer opportunities for future research.

AB	Primo Analytics from two campuses of the California State University system has revealed that a dramatically low proportion of Primo searches originate from mobile devices. The current study focuses on usability concerns as one area that may be preventing students from searching the Primo mobile interface. The sample for this study includes students from two campuses with a variety of experience with library instruction and searching the library's discovery system. Participants were given the same set of six common academic tasks to complete. Both mobile and desktop participants found three tasks relatively easy to complete. When there were differences in completion rates between the mobile and desktop users, the desktop users were overall more successful. No task was consistently difficult for desktop users to complete, while mobile users found two of the tasks very challenging to complete. Based on the findings, the authors make recommendations for improving the experience of mobile users.

AB	The irony is a verbal operant under multiple control, therefore, complex, with the function of letting the listener produce a response, usually contrary to what has been said and almost always with the purpose of ridicule. The objective of this article is, from a systematic review of literature, to map the variables (or their indicators) being studied in empiric researches and indicate essential elements for a functional analysis of irony. A search in the data bases BVS, NCBI, Science Direct, PsycInfo e Ebsco, using the keywords: irony, verbal irony, sarcasm, multiple control, autoclitics, and ironical and verbal behavior, produced 43 articles in psychology, linguistics or neuroscience. It was verified that in the functional analysis of irony the analyst should be aware of: (a) the characteristics of the members of the ironical verbal episode and the antecedents and consequents events of irony, and (b) consequences of the environmental variables that controls irony as humor, sarcasm, cynicism, or debauchery. The description of these empiric elements in other theoretical approaches can be useful for functional analysis of irony and contribute to the knowledge and to the experimental researches about this in behavior analysis.

AB	Problem: currently, the importance of strengthening the trunk for the gain of stability and in the prevention of lumbar pain has been identified. Objective: to describe and compare the effect of strength training on stable surfaces vs. strength training on unstable surfaces, on Core stability, in adults. Method: narrative review work in which a search for scientific information is carried out in the Ebsco, Elsevier, Embase, Medline, Pubmed and Scielo databases, selecting and analyzing articles from the year 2000, with search parameters such as Core stability, pain lumbar, trunk strengthening, stable and unstable surfaces. Results: n the first part, the anatomy of the spinal column and other structures that make up the Core are described in general; The panorama with respect to the prevalence of low back pain and its relevance for the strengthening of the trunk is expanded; some protocols for evaluating the strength and stability of this muscular belt are mentioned; some cross-sectional studies are compared in which it was intervened by means of stable and unstable surfaces, and its effect on muscular activity; Improvements in spinal stability obtained from interventions in controlled clinical trials are discussed. In the second part, a physical exercise program aimed at strengthening and stability of the Core is proposed, using stable surfaces to achieve the necessary adaptations that allow the subsequent use of unstable surfaces in order to strengthen the trunk. Conclusion: health care is also the responsibility of each person. It involves, among other aspects, consulting with professionals to correct or prevent diseases; get information from reliable sources; and undertake actions, such as physical activity, according to their needs, capacities and possibilities. This work deals with the importance of caring for the trunk or core area for the general health and functionality of the person, combining two widely used and valid techniques (stable and unstable surfaces), proposing an exercise program and guide for this purpose. For it to be carried out safely and efficiently, professional advice must be provided, specially today, due to the confinement by Covid-19.

Not all people identify themselves with one of the two socially established sexes: male or female, as they may identify themselves with both or none of them. The purpose of this article is to review the literature in order to explore the incidence of the theme of diversity in gender identity and expression in the Primary Education stage, and specifically in the area of Physical Education. The review was carried out in different databases and sources of international indexing: Dialnet, EBSCO, ERIC, DOAJ, Pubmed, and WOS, as well as in specialized books in fields close to the subject. No data addressing non-binary gender identities in the educational field was found within Primary Education and Physical Education. This shows a current and realistic topic pending to be approached from the educational field.

AB	Background and objective. During several years, dermatoglyphics is being used in sports as a marker of biological individuality, for the prediction of athletes' motor resources in different types of disciplines. These studies are used for selecting athletes with outstanding performances. The aim of this work is to identify the countries and sports in which dermatoglyphics has been used the most in the last decade in America, contrasting the results of dermatoglyphics with physical potential for sports performance, as well as the use of its instrumentation methods. The search includes open access publications, published in America in the last decade (2010 - 2019), in the English, Portuguese, or Spanish languages. The following databases were used: Web of Sciense, Scopus, Ebsco, Scielo, Redalyc, Dialnet, Pubmed, and Google Scholar. Several keywords were used to search for information. Results: a systematic search review was carried out in different databases, by which 1165 articles were identified, 13 of which met the inclusion criteria. The results show that countries like Colombia and Brazil are leaders in publications on this subject. Additionally, the sport with the highest number of publications in this area in the last decade is football. There is a high prevalence of traditional use of dermatoglyphics in relation to technology. Constant presence of loops was found, high index of D10 and SQTL, characteristics of sports that need speed, agility, coordination, and endurance. Conclusions. We need studies that integrate more sports, with larger samples, to assess whether the relationship of dermatoglyphics with physical abilities and sports performance is maintained.

It then describes a usability study conducted by the Franklin University Library in which 27 students searched for an article, an ebook, and a journal on two websites: one using a bento box and one using the EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS). Screen recordings of the searches were reviewed to see what actions users took while looking for information on each site, as well as how long the searches took. Students also filled out questionnaires to indicate what they thought of each type of search. Overall students found more items on the bento-box site, and indicated a slight preference for the bento-box search over EDS. The bento-box site also provided quicker results than the EDS site. As a result, the Franklin University library decided to implement bento-box searching on its website.

AB	Introduction: The World Health Organization considers prenatal depression as a major public health problem that currently affects 10-20% of pregnant women. It is mainly due to the great release of the hormone cortisol during pregnancy. In recent years, some disciplines such as Yoga, as a body-mind method including breathing techniques, physical postures (asanas) and meditation / relaxation, have gained importance as an alternative therapy against prenatal depression due to its relationship with the indexes and the symptoms of anxiety or stress in pregnant women.Objective: carry out a systematic review of randomized controlled studies on the changes that Yoga generates in the state of depression of pregnant women.Method: Following the Prisma Declaration, the search was conducted in the following databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Medline, Current Contents Connect, Ebsco, Web of Science and CINAHL-Complete. The articles included should be published in the last 10 years and should accomplish some inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search strategy was: "(Yoga) AND (Pregnant OR Prenatal OR Antenatal) AND (Depression)". Seven works with methodological quality >= 6 according to the PEDro scale were selected.Results: The articles that obtained favorable results (n = 4) presented: high participation (n> 90 subjects), good period of follow-up of the subjects (n=12 weeks) and high methodological quality (n=7 points). The articles with unfavorable results (n = 3) presented: low participation (n<60 subjects) and short follow-up period (n=9 weeks).Conclusion: Yoga has turned out to be a favorable alternative therapy to reduce depression rates in pregnant women.

AB	During the last twenty years, Central and Eastern European Online Library (CEEOL) became a leading database and repository offering a highly specialized and comprehensive collection of full text indexed documents in the fields of Humanities and Social Science publications from and about Central and Eastern Europe. Journal articles, eBooks and Grey Literature items are included in 50+ languages, allowing access to the primary source in one repository and fostering the language diversity in academic research and publishing.The dissemination process of the content in CEEOL includes the following discovery systems: Google Scholar, ProQuest's Serial Solutions, Summon, Primo Central, Alma, EBSCO's EDS Discovery Service and Knowledge Base, TDNet and OCLC. The CEEOL's partnership with Clarivate Analytics allows Web of Science editors having access to the CEEOL platform for easier analysis, selection and indexing of CEEOL journals that interest the Web of Science community. Institutional subscribers (states', universities', institutes' libraries, etc.) worldwide appreciate CEEOL for providing researchers, scholars, students, librarians and library patrons the access to indexed and archived Journals, eBooks and Grey Literature documents from and about Central and Eastern Europe by leading academic and scholarly publishers.The Bulgarian collection of journals and books holds a special place in CEEOL due to the high quality of scientific content and the depth and the completeness of the digital archives of the Bulgarian periodicals. CEEOL is a unique source of information for the development of Bulgarian humanities and social sciences for the past over 30 years, and that source could be used more widely in Bulgaria for supporting this development in the future. The study uses a comparative approach and analyzes the results of some of the business analytics tools of the CEEOL system.

AB	This work prospects the theoretical-methodological characterization of what we propose here as axiological epilinguistic practices, which are presented as expansions from proposals of epilinguistic practices made by Franchi and Geraldi. For this reason, we claim the mobilization of axiological concepts of intonation, judgment of value and the extra verbal of enunciation in processes of revision and rewriting. At the methodological plan, we analyze the process regarding the dialogue between one of the researchers and a student from Basic Education, after her text having been revised and rewritten according to criteria of nondialogical and cognitive order. Primal results show: a) that axiological epilinguistic practices, in the form of blocks of dialogical questionings, modify the character of review and rewriting, since they summon up the manifestation of the socio-ideological consciousness of the subject-author of the texts regarding the socio-ideological conducts represented in the text; b) it allows social life and discourse to emerge in the enunciation itself, what is materialized in the verbal style of language used, which becomes more free, fluid and expressive, with vocabulary and syntactic choices valued and directed to the whole of the evaluative completion of the enunciation as discursive acting, in what is expected with the work based on dialogism.

AB	Technique as a philosophical question has a double relevance: first one, insofar as it is considered as the essence of the human (only human being is a properly technical subject); the second one as it is considered as a vital function (although it arises in their heart, once created "no longer belongs to it", it is transhuman). For this reason, the aim of present paper is to expose two philosophical conceptions on technical essence of human being: Jose Ortega y Gasset's metaphysical conception and Hans Jonas bioethics conception. These positions will be analyzed from their respective problems: technique as a vital function, in the case of Ortega's perspectivism; and in the case of Jonas bioethics the technique as a possible cause of the destruction of the environment. Then, we will show the radical difference between them: while Ortega conceives technique as a vital function based on the concept of 'well-being', Jonas analyzes it from the concept of 'necessity' in an anthropological sense. The paper concludes explaining how, despite of these differences, both authors reach to the same conclusion: the technical exercise must summon to reflect anthropologically on the impact of the self-creations and the environment in to preserve quality of self-lives at the biological level (bio-ecology/bioethics).

It critically examines the advantages, disadvantages challenges, critical success factors, theories and models from the stakeholder's perspective. The paper also elucidates the changing trends in these themes along the progression of Web era. Electronic database like PROQUEST, EBSCO and JSTOR were accessed to search for tiered articles published between 2000 and 2018 using keywords such as "e learning", "web-based learning" and "online learning" in organizations. 138 articles from tiered journals were critically reviewed. It was found that in the last two decades there have been various social, technological and organizational factors that have impacted the e learning stakeholders and no stakeholder influences the world of electronic learning in isolation. All the stakeholders have to keep up to the changing trends of technology and the associated learning environment. Rapid technological advancements and aligned changes in the learning environment is the unremitting challenge that stakeholders' face, which when tackled competently yields an effective e learning environment.

AB	Recent years have seen an increase in the number of researchers and practitioners applying virtual reality (VR) to develop social skills, but varying levels of success have been observed when applying these VR training programs. Due to these disparities, review and summary work is needed to determine (a) whether these programs are effective and (b) the attributes of these programs that lead to success. In the current article, we perform a meta-analysis to determine the overall effectiveness of VR training programs for developing social skills, and we also study the effect of several moderating variables that may influence the effectiveness of these programs. We test whether certain aspects of the applied hardware (e.g. input devices, output devices), applied software (e.g. game elements, Second Life), participant population (e.g. general/specialized), and study design (e.g. type of control group, type of measure, others) influence the success of these programs. Sources were identified using EBSCO and Google Scholar, and, after our inclusion criteria were applied, 23 samples were included in our meta-analysis. Using a random-effects approach, we show that VR training programs, on average, perform better than alternative training programs for developing social skills, but almost all the other findings contradict current notions regarding these programs. Of note, gamified programs produced slightly worse outcomes than non-gamified programs, and programs utilizing immersive technologies (e.g. head-mounted displays) produced slightly worse outcomes than programs utilizing non-immersive displays (e.g. monitors). We provide suggestions regarding the effectiveness of VR training for social skills in comparison to alternative training approaches, the attributes of VR training programs that produce better outcomes, and directions for future research and practice.

Using the EBSCO, ScienceDirect and SCOPUS databases and a combination of SCRM keywords, 2851 articles were identified from the journals in year 2001-2017. Using the SSPP framework, 174 articles were reviewed as the basis for the analysis. This study firstly fits a matrix of 'redundant-flexible' organisational design with internal and external organisational structures and processes. Using this framework, supply chain scholars and managers may discuss the organisational fit of SCRM operations comprehensively. It also identifies the new areas for further studies.

In 2018, librarians at five campuses conducted a round of task-based individual user testing on their separate instances, seeking to review individual campuses' decisions about customizations designed to provide optimal performance of the system and provide insight into group decisions about our shared customization choices. Along with the findings of the test results and recommendations for enhancements to existing modifications, we discuss the challenges and opportunities that are present in conducting multi-campus usability testing and share recommendations for future consortium-based testing efforts.

AB	In 2015, the University of California, Berkeley, launched EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS), a web-scale discovery tool, with a goal of improving visibility and usage of collections. This study applies linear regression analysis to usage data for ebooks, ejournals, and abstracts and indexing (A&I) databases before and after implementation of EDS in order to identify correlations between the discovery layer and usage of library electronic resources across platforms. Our findings diverge from conclusions drawn in the previous literature that indicates that resource use generally increases after a discovery tool is implemented. We examine data from a longer period of time than the previous literature had, looking for statistically significant changes in resource use. The discovery layer at UC Berkeley did not lead to equal increases across platforms, but rather to a complex array of increases and decreases in use according to a variety of factors.

AB	Since the spring of 2014, the consumer virtual reality (VR) industry has once again been racing to reach the public, providing an opportunity to track an emerging medium's cultural integration in real time. We examined three sites on the sales chain that stretches from the laboratory to the living room: industry developer conferences, industrial prototypes, and end-user experiences. At each of these sites, marketers renegotiate VR's novelty in order to sell it to specific constituencies. Paradoxically, these negotiations reveal how VR, typically presented as a disruptive innovation, has been called upon to stabilize and ensure the continuity of the past: that is, of particular cultural forms and of the industrial and technological infrastructures that sustain them. We argue that the enculturation of VR demonstrates that the processes that summon new technologies and construct them as novel also reinforce existing-and often unspoken-agreements about the ways that culture should be organized.

AB	The Internet has made online learning possible, and many educators and researchers are interested in online learning courses to enhance and improve the student learning outcomes while battling the shortage in resources, facilities and equipment particularly in higher education institution. Online learning has become popular because of its potential for providing more flexible access to content and instruction at any time, from any place. It is imperative that the researchers consider, and examine the efficacy of online learning in educating students. For this study, the researchers reviewed literature through meta-analysis as the method of research concerning the use of ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) framework for designing and developing instructional materials that can provide wider access to quality higher education. This framework can be used to list generic processes that instructional designers and training developers use (Morrison et al., 2010). It represents a descriptive guideline for building effective training and performance support tools in five phases, as follows: 1.) Analysis, 2.) Design, 3.) Development, 4.) Implementation, and 5.) Evaluation. The researchers collected papers relating to online learning courses efficacy studies to provide a synthesis of scientifically rigorous knowledge in online learning courses, the researchers searched on ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), ProQuest databases, PubMed, Crossref, Scribd EBSCO, and Scopus. The researchers also conducted a manual search using Google Scholar. Based on the analysis, three main themes developed: 1.) comparison of online learning and traditional face-to-face setting, 2.) identification of important factors of online learning delivery, and 3.) factors of institutional adoption of online learning. Based on the results obtained 50 articles. The researchers examine each paper and found 30 articles that met the efficacy of online learning courses through having well-planned, well-designed courses and programs for higher education institution. Also, it highlights the importance of instructional design and the active role of institutions play in providing support structures for educators and students. Identification of different processes and activities in designing and developing an Online Learning Courses for Higher Education Institution will be the second phase of this study for which the researchers will consider using the theoretical aspect of the ADDIE framework.

AB	The debate on the effects of Multi Track Year-Round Education (MT-YRE) on educational outcomes remains unresolved in the conventional literature. Nevertheless, Ghana has introduced an MT-YRE in 400 schools to allow graduates from Junior High Schools, who for space constraints, would not have continued their formal educational journey, to enrol in Senior High Schools. The purpose of this study was to examine the prospects and challenges of the MT-YRE on educational outcomes and discuss their implications for educational policy in Ghana. The data used in the study were obtained through a review of literature from databases such as the Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), Ebsco, ProQuest and JSTOR and from grey sources such as institutional websites and online media publications. The results from a synthesis of the literature show that the MT-YRE has the prospects of increasing student enrolment while cutting down the cost of infrastructure provision. For instance, the literature indicates that student enrolment at the Senior High School level in Ghana has increased significantly with the introduction of the MT-YRE. However, other literature indicate that the MT-YRE affects educational outcomes negatively. It results in scheduling difficulties among families and denies students the opportunities to take summer jobs. A review of the Ghanaian MT-YRE reveals other challenges, which inlcude high administrative cost (employing more teachers) and poor academic performance of students (as a result of increased contact hours leading to behavioural problems caused by fatigue and boredom). The authors argue that poor academic performance among students is likely to defeat the government's Free SHS policy. This is because parents are likely to pay higher fees to enrol their non-performing wards in remedial classes. The cost of the lost years for these students may be difficult to quantify. Following the challenges identified, there is the need for educational policy makers to strategically plan towards the development of technical and vocational education to help accommodate the increasing students' enrolment. Finally, the progress of the MT-YRE should be carefully monitored and evaluated to guide future decision making.

AB	Social sciences librarians have an interest in supporting systematic reviews, but the available guidance is focused on health sciences settings. This study contributes guidance specifically for social sciences librarians using the Campbell Collaboration's standards to evaluate the search methods reported in systematic reviews on K-12 mathematics education. After searching ERIC (EBSCO), Education Source (EBSCO), Academic Search Ultimate (EBSCO), and Compendex (Engineering Village) in April 2018, we included 40 systematic reviews. The reviews were evaluated on the transparency of the reporting and the comprehensiveness of the search as required by the standards. The findings revealed deficiencies in search processes and reporting of search methods. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for librarians collaborating with social sciences researchers.

The Library had been an EBSCO Discovery Services (EDS) customer for six years, and the migration to Ex Libris's Alma-Primo negatively impacted content discovery and collection usage due to issues with EBSCO's proprietary metadata and Primo's OpenURL link resolver. This article discusses switching the library's collection using collection data analysis to respond to the change in discovery layer. The data-informed changes made to the collection improved collection usability and access.

AB	This systematic review aims to examine the existing literature concerning the association between father involvement and the development children's cognitive skills during early and middle childhood. Specifically, it analyzes: (1) how the number of researches developed across years; (2) which are the main socio-demographic characteristics of the samples; (3) which are the main focuses examined; and (4) which operational definitions were used to assess father involvement and children cognitive skills. Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, the articles were searched through PubMed and EBSCO (PsycInfo, PsycArticles, Education Source, Social Sciences Abstract, Family Studies Abstracts, Gender Studies Database and CINAHL complete). The findings suggest that, although each research used a different operational definition of the father involvement construct, in recent years there was a wide and constant interest increase about this issue. Most of the empirical studies utilized quantitative methods, whereas relatively few used qualitative and only one mixed methods. As regards the analysis of socio-demographic characteristics of the samples there is a great evidence that most of them included biological and residential fathers: it may reflect that this type of sample is easier to recruit than non-residential and non-biological fathers. Regarding the socio- economic status and the ethnicity of families, the data highlighted how in recent years the literature on father involvement is starting to look at differences in ethnic and cultural backgrounds, in contrast to past researches. The findings revealed that the main focus is the impact of father involvement on children's cognitive skills and the most of the studies highlighted that it is positive and statistically significant. Regarding to the assessment of father involvement and children's cognitive skills, the literature is quite heterogeneous.

AB	Adults (more than 18 years old) are likely to reproduce the habits that they acquired during childhood and adolescence (from 6 to 16 years old). For that reason, teachers and parents have the responsibility to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in children and adolescents. Even though every school subject should promote healthy activities, Physical Education (PE) is the most important subject to foster well-being habits associated to healthy lifestyle during sport practice and other kinds of active tasks. Indeed, there are many factors that influence the acquisition of healthy habits that should be taken into account when programs and activities are implemented in both educational and extracurricular context. In this sense, psychological and social factors are of utmost importance to achieve optimal experiences for an active and healthy lifestyle. However, due to the myriad of studies analyzing different factors in different contexts, there could be confusion when programs and pedagogical strategies are applied in educational or extracurricular contexts. The objective of this investigation is to analyse the state of art of the psychosocial factors which influence the engagement in physical activities and sport practice. The keywords used in this review were mainly: "Self-Determination Theory," "(intrinsic) motivation," "Psychological need satisfaction," "physical activity and sport engagement," "Elementary Education," "Secondary Education," "Physical Education." In addition, the Boolean data type "and," "or," and "not" were also used. The articles were selected according to the following criteria: (a) peer-reviewed original research published in international journals indexed in JCR or SJR, (b) published in English or Spanish, (c) about psychosocial factors which influence the physical activity and sport engagement, (d) in educational or extracurricular context. Research articles selected were found through Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, SportDiscus (EBSCO-host), ERIC, PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo databases. It was observed that physical activities and sport practice engagement are closely related to psychological factors. In particularly, intrinsic motivation was able to determine the active participation in any activity, including physical activity and sport practice during the implementation of Small-Sided Games and other kinds of pedagogical strategies (e.g., Pedagogical Models). Motivation was also closely related to flow state. Finally, these variables should be considered in order to organize effective programs to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in Physical Education classes.

AB	After feedback from faculty, students, and staff on the viability of starting a print demand driven acquisitions service, Old Dominion University Libraries (ODU) in collaboration with ProQuest Coutts and Ex-Libris implemented a print DDA pilot project in the fall of 2017. The project planning team addressed and resolved a variety of challenges including software development, record duplication, and order fulfillment. As a result of their efforts, Print DDA is now considered one of the Libraries most efficient options for satisfying the informational and research demands of ODU faculty and students. This article examines all aspects of planning and implementing print DDA as well as the adjustments made by the planning team to improve the service.

AB	Academic libraries are increasingly purchasing electronic books (e-books) via demand driven acquisitions (DDA) programs. However, there is no guarantee about the quality of DDA titles. This is especially true for consortially managed DDA pools or when pools include all titles from selected publishers. This study analyzes data from EBSCO's GOBI acquisitions platform to assess the quality of the pool and purchased titles from the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL) publisher-based DDA program. Results showed that most available and selected titles were appropriate for academic libraries. Popular and lower level academic titles made up a relatively small portion of the DDA pool but were selected at a proportionally higher rate than other titles. The DDA pool was weighted towards titles that had been previously purchased by few GOBI libraries, but users tended to select titles that had been purchased by more GOBI libraries. Implications of these results are discussed from the point of view of a consortium member library using the DDA program as a supplement to its broader collections of print and e-books.

AB	Aggression is one of the most common Paediatric Psychiatric emergency problems presented in healthcare services with major public health impacts. The aim of this review is to determine the psychosocial predictors of adolescent aggression. Systematic review on observational study designs were conducted. Recent five years English published journal articles (2014-2018) were searched in three databases (Science Direct, PubMed and EBSCO) from April 2018 until May 2018. The final 15 articles (seven prospective cohort, eight cross-sectional studies) were included in the systematic review. Psychological predictors were mainly on the personality traits and emotional problems experienced by the adolescents including callous-unemotional traits, hostility, anger, and low empathy. Self-control was found to be protective against adolescent aggression. Social predictors that contribute to the aggression among adolescents according to the highest reported number of articles were peer influence, followed by school climate, substance use, neighbourhood influence, family, and parent factors. In conclusion, psychosocial predictors of adolescent aggression include both Psychological Factors; mainly personality traits and emotional problems, and Social Factors; mainly peer influence and substance use. This warrants for more holistic approach in dealing with aggressive adolescents that can be applied in more targeted and focused intervention strategy deliveries.

AB	The problem of suffering crucially focuses on meaninglessness. Meaningful suffering-suffering having some "point" or function-is not as problematic as absurd suffering that cannot be rendered purposeful. 'Ibis issue is more specific than the problem of the "meaning of life" (or "meaning in life"). Human lives are often full of suffering experienced as serving no purpose whatsoever - indeed, suffering that may threaten to make life itself meaningless. Some philosophers-e.g., D.Z. Phillips and John Cottingham have persuasively argued that the standard analytic methods of philosophy of religion in particular ought to be enriched by literary reading and interpretation, especially when dealing with issues such as this. The problem of evil and suffering can also be explored from a perspective entangling literary and philosophical approaches (Kivisto & Pihlstrom, 2016). This double methodology is in this paper applied to the problem of evil and suffering by considering an example drawn from Holocaust literature: Primo Levi's work is analyzed as developing an essentially ethical argument, with a philosophical-cum-literary structure, against theodicies seeking to render suffering meaningful. By means of such a case study, I hope to shed light on the problem of meaningless suffering, especially regarding the moral critique of "theodicist" attempts to interpret all suffering as meaningful.

AB	The changes in the world of work and organizations and their impact on people's lives have raised it new way of approaching the relationship between work and happiness. A bibliometric study is carried out of the works on the economy of happiness that have been published in Spanish between 2000 and 2018. To do so, the LDS-Multidisciplinary search engine (EBSCO Discovery Service) is used. selecting 95 publications that deal with this subject. As a result of the study a greater production of theoretical approaches is found on the subject as opposed to empirical research. In the latter the works are fundamentally analyzed from the economic and psychological perspective. The clearly growing trend of scientific production on happiness and work has two important aspects: On the one hand, the very time of great changes. which emerges continuously new explanatory and prescriptive paradigms; and, on the other hand, this increase agrees with the end of the economic crisis. Overcoming and leaving behind the preoccupations of this great imbalance of the world economic system has once again focused the interest on making companies more productive and humane, preserving occupational health and improving personal development. In this sense, the urgent need fir a multidisciplinary approach to this area from empirical research that contributes to improving relations between the world of work and the subjective well-being of people is highlighted.

AB	Background: Among twins, lower linguistic skills emerged when compared with singletons. Considering the association found between parental linguistic input and children's language development, exploring the differences between twins and singleton's linguistic environments could find variables that are potentially associated with the lower linguistic skills of twins.Aim: The current systematic review aims to analyze and systematize the existing literature focused on the comparison of twins' and singletons' linguistic environments within their first 3 years of life. Methodological issues (i.e., the procedure used to assess the linguistic environment, the coding of the linguistic environment's features, the computational method employed to assess the parental linguistic input, and participant characteristics) and differences found among twins and singletons regarding their linguistic environment (i.e., linguistic input quantity, linguistic input complexity, linguistic features of child-directed speech, parental responsiveness, and directiveness, joint attention, and book reading) were highlighted.Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was followed. Eligible studies were searched through EBSCO, PubMed, and Web of Science. From this search, 1,347 study results emerged, and 8 studies were included.Results: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review focused on the comparison of twins' and singletons' linguistic environments. Differences between the groups were found in all of the included studies. Data against twins were generally identified regarding all the considered linguistic environment's features. However, conflicting results within and between the included studies emerged, mainly according to the computational method employed (i.e., twin moms value, twin direct dyadic value, twin direct dyadic + both value, and input directed toward both children simultaneously).Conclusion: The disadvantaged linguistic environment of twins is likely due to limited parental resources and demands associated with the management of two children of the same age. However, the limited and conflicting data found did not allow for a firm conclusion to be drawn on the differences in the twins' and singletons' linguistic environments. Further studies on the topic are needed.

AB	The identification of predictors of the intention to purchase organic foods is of interest to several professionals and researchers. The Theory of Planned Behavior is one of the main theoretical models used for this purpose. This review identifies the effect of additional constructs used to improve TCP's predictive power with a focus on the intent to purchase organic foods. The following databases were considered: EBSCO, SPELL, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsychINFO. 12 papers were found. The identified constructs were: moral attitudes/norms, descriptive norms, past behavior, health consciousness, self-identity, environmental concern, past experience and trust. Moral attitudes/norms are the most used construct and with the greatest single effect found. Detailed results and discussions are presented.

AB	E-book platforms have multiplied among vendors and publishers, complicating not only acquisitions and collection development decisions, but also the user experience. Using a methodology of task-based user testing, the researchers sought to measure and compare user performance of eight common tasks on nine e-book platforms: EBSCO eBooks, Pro Quest Ebook Central, Gale Virtual Reference Library (GVRL), Oxford Reference, Safari Books Online, IGI Global, CRCnetBASE, Springer Link, and JSTOR. Success and failure rates per task, average time spent per task, and user comments were evaluated to gauge the usability of each platform. Findings indicate that platforms vary widely in terms of users' ability and speed in completing known-item searches, navigation tasks, and identification of specialized tools, with implications for library acquisition and user instruction decisions. Results also suggest several key vendor design recommendations for an optimal user experience. The study did not aim to declare a "winning" platform, and all the platforms tested demonstrated both strengths and weaknesses in different aspects, but overall performance and user preference favored Pro Quest's Ebook Central platform.

As a result, more and more organizations need of information literacy enabled people, due to the massive production of data and information in Industry 4.0. The objective is to identify how the scientific literature has dealt with information literacy in the context of Industry 4.0.Method: Used the Systematic Review of Literature with a qualitative approach, from the search of 10 national and international databases: ProQuest LISA, EBSCO LISTA, BRAPCI, ENANCIB Proceedings, SCOPUS, SciELO, Web of Science, Erudit and the Portal of Periodicals of CAPES.Result: It is evident that there is a knowledge gap regarding information literacy in the context of Industry 4.0. In this perspective, it is highlighted that it is an opportunity for the development of research in this field of knowledge. In addition, researchers have shown some concern about the potential consequences of Industry 4.0, such as reduced employment and rising social inequality.Conclusions: The Information literacy is the first step for society to be able to deal with the problems triggered by Industry 4.0. Thus, its development, application and consolidation are crucial for people to criticize these transformations intelligently. The society need to understand the interests of developers of disruptive technologies, the role of government and the interests of entrepreneurs. This understanding occurs through access, appropriation, reflection, criticism, use and reuse of information intelligently.

AB	The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest trend of the current ICT evolution, represented by a huge amount of powerful smart devices that have started to appear on the Internet. By responding to this new trend, many cloud providers have started to offer services for IoT management. Recent advances have already shown that cloud computing can be used to serve IoT needs by performing data generation, processing and visualization tasks. In this currently forming ecosystem, IoT system developers need to purchase, connect and configure these devices, and they also have to choose the right infrastructure provider offering the combination of protocols and data structures fitting their applications. In this paper, we propose a complex, semi-simulation environment that aims to provide a solution for these IoT challenges. Our main contribution is the the design of an Android-based, mobile IoT device simulator called MobIoTSim. We also propose a customizable cloud gateway to manage these devices by receiving, processing and visualizing sensor data coming from MobIoTSim. To be as close as possible to real world application, we created an IoT trace archive service called SUMMON, which can be used to gather real-world sensor data, which can be used by MobIoTSim. Finally, we demonstrate how to create IoT applications utilizing numerous IoT devices with this environment, and evaluate the device management scalability and responsiveness of its components.

AB	Germany is a representative democracy. In accordance with the Grundgesetz (Basic Law) the members of the Bundestag are "representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience". Power in the German Bundestag is centred around the fractions. Therefore, a key question with regard to the political system is how much freedom the members of parliament have under the umbrella of their fractions, to what extent is the scope of the parliamentarians' actions limited by the organisation and hierarchy of the fractions, more simply, just how democratic are the fractions really. This paper in the journal Gruppe. Interaktion. Organisation highlights how much the largely unwritten rules and structures of the Bundestag influence the parliamentarians' work and decisions. It analyses the areas of tension between dependence and independence, as well as cooperation and competition, and power and powerlessness and discusses their effects on the democratic system within the institution Bundestag. These fields of tension are no either-or, but poles between which the members of parliament must navigate on a day-to-day basis depending on the problem, situation and context. Parliamentarians can only be successful if they are able to find their way between these poles confidently, if they can live with and in disaccord and as a result are able to summon up a considerable degree of flexibility and tolerance for ambiguity.

AB	The stark realism of Primo Levi's experiences of the Shoah is considered in light of the current political climate in which the authoritarian other induces a divergence between reality, a state of things as they actually exist or existed, and truth, that which to some extent accords to reality. In this paper I will consider how truth becomes divorced from reality by considering Giegerich's interpretation of Plato's Parable of the Cave, arguing that truth is affected by perception and belief. After addressing 'truth' in justice, analytic work and the family, the post-truth phenomenon is discussed and defined as a force erosive to reason and sensibility; its general purpose is to avoid doubt and anxiety. The past is interpreted and re-interpreted to advance multiple geopolitical interests. Levi warned, in 1976, that the authoritarian state considers it quite permissible to alter the perception of what is true.

AB	Background. Writing composition is a significant factor for measuring test-takers' ability in any language exam. However, the assessment (scoring) of these writing compositions or essays is a very challenging process in terms of reliability and time. The need for objective and quick scores has raised the need for a computer system that can automatically grade essay questions targeting specific prompts. Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are used to overcome the challenges of scoring writing tasks by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature for the AES systems used for grading the essay questions.Methodology. We have reviewed the existing literature using Google Scholar, EBSCO and ERIC to search for the terms "AES'', "Automated Essay Scoring'', "Automated Essay Grading'', or "Automatic Essay'' for essays written in English language. Two categories have been identified: handcrafted features and automatically featured AES systems. The systems of the former category are closely bonded to the quality of the designed features. On the other hand, the systems of the latter category are based on the automatic learning of the features and relations between an essay and its score without any handcrafted features. We reviewed the systems of the two categories in terms of system primary focus, technique(s) used in the system, the need for training data, instructional application (feedback system), and the correlation between e-scores and human scores. The paper includes three main sections. First, we present a structured literature review of the available Handcrafted Features AES systems. Second, we present a structured literature review of the available Automatic Featuring AES systems. Finally, we draw a set of discussions and conclusions.Results. AES models have been found to utilize a broad range of manually-tuned shallow and deep linguistic features. AES systems have many strengths in reducing labor-intensive marking activities, ensuring a consistent application of scoring criteria, and ensuring the objectivity of scoring. Although many techniques have been implemented to improve the AES systems, three primary challenges have been identified. The challenges are lacking of the sense of the rater as a person, the potential that the systems can be deceived into giving a lower or higher score to an essay than it deserves, and the limited ability to assess the creativity of the ideas and propositions and evaluate their practicality. Many techniques have only been used to address the first two challenges.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish if organisational factors are leading to a negative effect on ambulance personnel's health. In recent years, frontline ambulance personnel have displayed a consistent high rate of sickness amongst healthcare workers within the National Health Service in the UK. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has previously been cited, but organisational factors may be stressors to health. Design/methodology/approach A search of electronic databases MEDLINE EBSCO, MEDLINE OVID, MEDLINE PUBMED, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, Zetoc within the time period of 2000-2017 resulted in six mixed methods studies. Hand searching elicited one further study. The literature provided data on organisational and occupational stressors (excluding PTSD) relating to the health of 2,840 frontline ambulance workers in the UK, Australia, Norway, the Netherlands and Canada. The robust quantitative data were obtained from validated questionnaires using statistical analysis, whilst the mixed quality qualitative data elicited similar themes. Narrative synthesis was used to draw theories from the data. Findings Organisational factors such as low job autonomy, a lack of supervisor support and poor leadership are impacting on the health and well-being of frontline ambulance workers. This is intertwined with the occupational factors of daily operational demands, fatigue and enforced overtime, so organisational changes may have a wider impact on daily occupational issues. Originality/value The findings have possible implications for re-structuring organisational policies within the ambulance service to reduce staff sickness.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to systematically review published literature for the research question "what issues are considered (and changes made) for vulnerable groups as part of the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive (CBRNe) response for casualty collection, decontamination, triage and casualty clearing processes?". Design/methodology/approach Seven-stage framework from the PRISMA statement for research question, eligibility (definition), search, identification of relevant papers from title and abstract, selection and retrieval of papers, appraisal and synthesis. Data sources: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus (Elsevier), Chemical Abstracts, Assia (Proquest), Sociological abstracts (Proquest), Cinahl, HMIC, Health business elite, PsycInfo (ebsco), PILOTS (Proquest) and supplemented by other search strategies (e.g. exploding reference lists). The included references were critically appraised using the mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT). Findings Results: 1,855 papers were returned from the literature search, of which 221 were screened by abstract and 48 by full paper. In total, 11 papers were included for appraisal, of which three achieved a quality score of 50 per cent or over. The papers were categorised into three phases on CBRNe response; evacuation, triage and decontamination.Originality/value Although very little new medium/high quality research is available, the findings are summarised as considerations for building design (route choice and information), communication (including vision, hearing and language differences) and the composition of the response team. It is suggested that evidence-based practice from other care domains could be considered (patient movement and handling) for fire service and ambulance guidelines.

AB	Purpose Various literature have contextualised value co-creation concept in the music business and how that notion puts into practice in benefitting the actors in this particular business. The purpose of this paper is to review the extant literature to comprehend regarding the applicability of co-creation in music business which can be used to map and evaluate strategies used to stimulate and exercise co-creation experiences; focus from such co-creational activities; stages during which co-creation occurred; channels in which the music as cultural product is delivered; and the co-creative platform used that can be useful for practitioners as well as scholars in the music business. Design/methodology/approach Of the available academic databases that exist on the online platform, this study takes into account six scholarly databases, i.e., Emerald, EBSCO, ISI Web of Sciences, ProQuest, ScienceDirect and Scopus. Findings Having filtered through the initial 113 papers that fulfil the predetermined criteria, this study discovers 33 empirical journal and proceeding papers that have discussed the co-creation concept in the music context from 2011 to 2017. Originality/value This paper is the first to integrate five practical criteria as to how co-creation is applied and contextualised in the music business. It also contributes to the academic literature by presenting an exhaustive selective review of the value co-creation concept and its applicability to the music business.

AB	This critical appraisal and synthesis review explores the literature on the evidence of Rorschach Inkblot Method variables as measures of the attachment theory. We searched for publications making use of EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) which included 41 databases of which Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, PsycARTICLES, and PsycINFO yielded the most results. Inclusion criteria were published studies concerning Rorschach and attachment theory where participants were older than 18 years. Non-academic literature and studies not published in English were excluded. We synthesised the evidence following the narrative approach of Petticrew and Roberts (2006). Findings suggest texture, oral responses, and Rorschach oral dependency strongly associated with attachment security, with other variables indicating weaker associations with attachment.

AB	The aim of this article is to present a bibliometric review on research that works on Theory of Mind (ToM) and Personality. Initially, we found 75 studies of which Thirty studies were selected from the Scopus, Science Direct, EBSCO, PubMed, Scielo and Springer databases, published between 2012 and 2016. We found a relationship between ToM with personality disorders such as, borderline, narcissistic and antisocial disorder. Also, a relationship with specific features such as low empathy, attachment type and high levels of emotional insensitivity. It is concluded that although progress has been made in the knowledge of the relationship between ToM and personality, the investigations are not extensive enough to clarify how this interaction operates with all dimensions and personality traits in subjects with and without psychopathology.

AB	Objective: This article aims to systematically review the academic production on crops of illicit use, eradication and anti-drug policies implemented, and to show the progress in their study. Methodology: Based on a systematic review, institutional and 3 academic catalogs were consulted: Proquest, Jstor, Ebsco. The inclusion criteria were: published academic papers, publications of the last two decades that had as a topic the crops of illicit use. Results: three thematic lines were identified: causes of the planting of illicit crops, eradication mechanisms, and anti-drug policies implemented, with which it is evidenced that the wide existing production is not only a topic approached from the perspective of the State responsibility or illegal armed actors, but also, as a more complex issue that links cultural, regional and environmental economy processes. Conclusions: Although illicit crops have been configured as a problem that persists, academic production in Colombia is still debating between studies on their impacts, efficient substitution mechanisms, assessment on the effectiveness of restitution policies and their impact on the economic and social development of the country.

AB	For the very first time this in-depth paper studies the archives of the historic Paolo Pigna Paper Mill of Alzano Lombardo (Bergamo, Italy), which played a leading role in Italian history and culture: so much so that it ended up with fusing its own image to the very market where it operated, that is, the Italian schools. After being taken over by Paolo Pigna in 1867, the great paper mill immediately became known not only for its high-quality production but also for keeping abreast of technology and emerging in a sector of the economy, which in the mid-1800s was fragmented into a multitude of small and poorly mechanized artisan workshops. The Author retraces one hundred years of the history of the company and its production for schools: in particular its production of exercise books - a simple but effective and all-pervading medium of iconic-verbal messages (moral, educational, propagandistic, religious, etc.).

AB	The aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review of therapeutic interventions for victims and perpetrators of dating violence among adolescents and young people published between 1997 to 2019 in Spanish, English, French and Portuguese. The search was conducted by two independent researchers in SCOPUS, EBSCO, psyINFO, ScienceDirect, Redalyc, Web of Science, Pubmed, Proquest and manual searching. Ten therapeutic interventions were selected for victims and perpetrators of dating violence. Most of the programs were developed in the United States and three in Ibero-America. In general, these investigations report significant effects in reduction of dating violence. However, it is considered necessary for the next interventions to evaluate the behavioral change on short and long term and their effects in revictimization based on experimental designs in different contexts or communities.

AB	Type 2 diabetes is a non-communicable disease that affects most people around the world and is generally the result of excessive food intake and physical inactivity. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to identify facilitators and barriers for lifestyle modifications among type 2 diabetes patients. We combined quantitative and qualitative studies for this systematic narrative review. A literary search was carried out using EBSCO, High Wire Press, Medline, PsycInfo, PubMed and Scopus. Narrative review was used to extract results from quantitative studies, while thematic synthesis was used to extract results from qualitative studies. Twenty-three studies were included in this review, with a total of 2287 participants from Western, Arab and Asian populations. The two main themes generated from this review are intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors that can either be facilitators or barriers to implementing lifestyle change. Among the barriers faced by the participants are established food habits, lack of self-efficacy, lack of motivation, lack of social support, inadequate knowledge, low socio-economic status, food culture and poor time management. In contrast, the facilitating factors generated are strong self-efficacy, high motivation, good habits, and sufficient knowledge. In general, patients with diabetes observed more barriers than facilitators to implementing healthy lifestyle changes.

AB	The avocado (Persea americana Mill) is an edible fruit of economic importance of the Lauraceae Family. It is native to Central America and the Caribbean but its cultivation has spread to other tropical and subtropical regions of the planet. This work summarizes information related to research on the biological properties of this species and discusses relevant aspects of its use as insecticide and the possibility of performing nanoformulations from its oils and extracts. The objective of the research was to evaluate the state of the art on the biological properties of Persea americana Mill (avocado) from 1900 to 2019. The methodology used consisted of consulting international databases such as HighWire, DOAJ, EBSCO, Scielo, Scopus, Chemical abstract, Medline, PudMed, and Pharmaceutical Abstract. The results showed that the phytochemistry of Persea americanaca Mill has been widely studied for leaves, fruit and seeds. The chemical composition of this species is characterized by different groups of metabolites, which can be divided into various derivatives that contain furan ring, glycosides, terpenoids, flavonoids and coumarins. The main family of phenolic compounds found in avocado peels and seeds are (epi) catechin derivatives. A large variety of pharmacological activities have been reported for the different organs (leaves, fruits, seeds and bark) of P. americana Mill. as hypocholesterolemic, hypotensive, antiinflammatory, hypoglycaemic, analgesic, antioxidant, anticonvulsant, cicatrizant and anticancer. Although the use as an insecticide of Persea americana extracts has been demonstrated, no nanoformulation based on these extracts used to fight insects was found in the literature review.

AB	Grievances and an urgent awareness of the need for social change are necessary but insufficient catalysts for the formation of powerful and robust social movements. While this realization has led observers of social movements to attend to a wide variety of structural and subjective factors, in the alchemy of radical social change and the grassroots collective action that fuels it one of the most important yet under considered elements is the radical imagination. In this paper, I map the concept of the radical imagination and the methods necessary to study it in action. A collective activity produced through dialogic encounters rather than an individual possession or faculty, the radical imagination is our capacity to conceive of the world as it might be otherwise, and it animates successful movements for social change. Since the radical imagination is something people do together it is also a profoundly social phenomenon bearing the marks of the activist culture and political context in which it is enmeshed, and the forms used to mediate and circulate it. This, in turn, has profound consequences for the way activists sustain themselves, organize for social change, and connect with others beyond their ranks. Drawing on research conducted since 2010 with radical activists in Halifax, Canada seeking to convoke' - collectively summon into being - the radical imagination, I reflect on the relationship between the radical imagination, activist culture and context, and movement building in the age of austerity.

AB	Recently, big data streams have become ubiquitous due to the fact that a number of applications generate a huge amount of data at a great velocity. This made it difficult for existing data mining tools, technologies, methods, and techniques to be applied directly on big data streams due to the inherent dynamic characteristics of big data. In this paper, a systematic review of big data streams analysis which employed a rigorous and methodical approach to look at the trends of big data stream tools and technologies as well as methods and techniques employed in analysing big data streams. It provides a global view of big data stream tools and technologies and its comparisons. Three major databases, Scopus, ScienceDirect and EBSCO, which indexes journals and conferences that are promoted by entities such as IEEE, ACM, SpringerLink, and Elsevier were explored as data sources. Out of the initial 2295 papers that resulted from the first search string, 47 papers were found to be relevant to our research questions after implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study found that scalability, privacy and load balancing issues as well as empirical analysis of big data streams and technologies are still open for further research efforts. We also found that although, significant research efforts have been directed to real-time analysis of big data stream not much attention has been given to the preprocessing stage of big data streams. Only a few big data streaming tools and technologies can do all of the batch, streaming, and iterative jobs; there seems to be no big data tool and technology that offers all the key features required for now and standard benchmark dataset for big data streaming analytics has not been widely adopted. In conclusion, it was recommended that research efforts should be geared towards developing scalable frameworks and algorithms that will accommodate data stream computing mode, effective resource allocation strategy and parallelization issues to cope with the ever-growing size and complexity of data.

AB	This issue's Alert Collector offering on audiobooks is a departure from the usual subject-based column. With the wide availability of downloadable audiobooks, there is a huge opportunity for libraries to serve readers who would rather listen on their mobile devices. Renee Young, a Metadata Librarian III with EBSCO, offers some great advice for any librarian trying to build or improve their audiobook collection. She also suggests ways to promote your collection and help those you serve find great new "reads" in audiobook format. Young is a former reviewer of audiobooks for Booklist, served as member and chair of Listen List Council of the Collection Development and Evaluation Section (CODES) of the Reference and User Services Association (RUSA), and has presented on listener's advisory at national conferences. Her "listening" skills go back to before becoming a librarian: she served in the US Army as a cryptologic linguist, which involved listening to and translating radio transmissions.-Editor

AB	Speech-related professionals such as speech language pathologists (SLPs) and audiologists make use of neuro-advancements including neurotechnologies such as cochlear implants (CIs), brain-computer interfaces, and deep brain stimulation. Speech-related professionals could occupy many roles in relation to their interaction with neuro-advancements reflecting the roles expected of them by their professional organizations. These roles include: service provider, promoter of neuro-products such as CIs, educator of others, neuro-related knowledge producer and researcher, advocates for their fields and their clients in relation to neuro-advancements, and influencers of neuro-policy, neuroethics and neuro-governance discussions. Lifelong learning, also known as professional development, is used as a mechanism to keep professionals up to date on knowledge needed to perform their work and could be used to support the fulfillment of all the roles in relation to neuro-advancements. Using 300 English language Canadian newspapers and academic articles from SCOPUS and the 70 databases of EBSCO-Host as sources, we found that the neuro-advancement content linked to speech-related professionals centered around CIs and brain computer interfaces, with other neuro-technologies being mentioned much less. Speech-related professionals were mostly mentioned in roles linked to clinical service provision, but rarely to not at all in other roles such as advocate, researcher or influencer of neuroethics and neuro-governance discussions. Furthermore, lifelong learning was not engaged with as a topic. The findings suggest that the mentioning of and engagement with roles of speech-related professionals linked to neuro-advancements falls short given the expectations of roles of speech-related professionals for example. We submit that these findings have implications for the education of speech-related professionals, how others perceive the role and identity of speech-related professionals, and how speech-related professionals perceive their own role.

AB	Background: Teachers in various countries worldwide have been confronted with the placement of students with disabilities in general classes, and the need to provide them with support and adapted physical education (APE). However, physical education (PE) teachers often do not feel prepared or self-confident enough for this inclusion. While a considerable amount of research has been identified, researchers have emphasized a need for additional studies that can shed more light on the influencing factors relevant to shaping teachers' attitudes towards inclusion, as well as on their inclusion practices. Purpose: The current article aims to provide a narrative summary of international research perspectives and findings regarding PE teachers' attitudes and self-efficacy (SE) toward inclusion, as well as to develop a model for conducting further research. Design: A narrative literature review was performed, based on a search of the databases SPORT Discus and MEDLINE (combined via EBSCO host and screened for peer-reviewed academic journals only), and Google Scholar. The search used the following terms: physical education teachers, inclusion, disability, and attitudes or SE. The narrative review begins with setting the scope of this topic via definitions and theoretical frameworks used to enable the understanding of attitudes and SE within inclusive PE. The Social Learning Theory (SLT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) were outlined in order follow up with an explanation of the link between attitudes and SE. In the next section, the literature on attitudes and SE of PE teachers is presented. This section is comprised of subsections describing the development of instruments and their utilization in the field of study, as well as contextual variables influencing PE teachers' attitudes and SE toward inclusion. Findings: Seventy-five articles were included in total, of which 54 discussed research on teachers' attitudes towards inclusive PE, 12 were related to research on teachers' SE (three of which also included research on teachers' attitudes towards inclusion), and 12 were considered reviews or viewpoints. The article ends with a model, including the following parts: background variables (regarding teachers' personal attributes, school attributes, and disability attributes); moderating variables (attitude and SE); and, teachers' behavior toward inclusion, all of which are interrelated and include a feedback loop. This model can be used for designing future research, as well as evidence-based interventions aimed at facilitating teacher training toward inclusion. Summary for practitioners: From a practical point of view, educational inclusion practitioners should be aware of several factors influencing attitudes and/or SE while engaging in inclusion of children with disabilities in PE: (a) The teachers' volume and type of experience with persons with disabilities at school, in the family or in the community; (b) The professional and academic training toward inclusion; (c) Individual factors, including gender; (d) School environmental factors, such as a process rather than performance orientation; and, finally, (e) The type and degree of disability.

The results from 19 selected articles show a small number of investigations, distributed in 5 countries. Most of the studies are cross-sectional, tend to include low and middle socio-economic status adolescents from the age of 14, mainly use self report questionnaires related to parent relationships and aim to investigate about associations between attachment and psychopathology, psychological adjustment, specific relational contexts, such as adoption, or they are oriented towards the validation of instruments. Based on these results, challenges for adolescence attachment research in Latin America in the future are pointed out.

AB	This work aims to present the contexts, concepts, advantages and limitations of the main approaches for the simultaneous retrieval of information in distinct resources: federated search or metasearch and the web discovery service, presented here as an evolution of the federated search. It also aimed to verify if university libraries in public higher education institutions in Brazil have adhered to the use of web scale discovery services (WSDSs) for a greater visibility of their physical and online collections, thus adapting to the interests of the "Google Generation". The methodology consisted of the identification of Brazilian public higher education institutions through the e-MEC System and, from there, the search of the libraries websites or the library systems of the identified institutions, aiming to point those that use the services of web discovery. The research demonstrated that, even though promising, web-based discovery services are not yet a reality for most libraries of Brazilian public higher education institutions, and reflects on the reasons for the low adherence rate.

AB	In the current paper, research on risk communication regarding radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) of mobile communication technologies is systematically reviewed. The following databases were searched in March 2017: EBSCO (PsycInfo, Academic search premier), Medline, SCOPUS, and emf-portal.org. Of 1139 unique hits, 28 articles (including 27 studies) remained after full-text eligibility screening. The majority of studies were experiments. The quality of all studies was evaluated against standardised criteria. Studies were assigned to nine different categories of content. Categories were comprehensibility of information (four studies), information on the (non-)existence of the risk (2), information about uncertainty (3), information focussed on different health effects (3), information about the source of the information (2), information about individual risk and exposure aspects (5), information about precautionary measures (14), effects of television reports and audio-visual advertisements (4), information regarding base station siting (2). For each topic, findings were summarised and, if possible, a recommendation for risk communication practice was derived. Throughout the topics, many studies did not only analyse the main effects but also interactions with recipient characteristics. Interaction analyses suggest that especially prior risk perception shapes the individual evaluation of information about RF-EMF and has an influence on perceived credibility, interpretation of verbal descriptors of uncertainty, perceived persuasiveness of arguments and the communication ' s effect on risk perception. For information about precautionary measures, the evidence was combined in a meta-analysis. Mean effects showed a significant increase of risk perception regarding mobile phones and mobile phone base stations due to information about precaution (Hedges ' g = .16, 95% confidence interval (.05; .26) for mobile phone risk perception, g = .17 (.10; .24) for base station risk perception). Strategies for dealing with the influence of prior risk perception are discussed. Finally, limitations of the current study and potential avenues for future research are outlined.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight critical issues facing women of color (WOC) faculty and to synthesize the research literature in order to offer recommendations for action to address inequities using an intersectionality framework.Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a qualitative meta-analysis. Relevant articles were obtained through a search of the EBSCO and Google Scholar databases entering in combinations of specific keywords. In order to be included in this review, the manuscripts had to be published between the years 2001 and 2017; in a peer-reviewed journal; and available through the university library system.Findings The majority of manuscripts in the meta-analysis revealed high teaching and service loads, ambiguous standards for tenure and lack of culturally responsive mentorship are challenges experienced by WOC faculty. Moreover, there is limited research that examines STEM WOC faculty experiences at minority-serving institutions and in leadership roles. Further research is needed to examine the long-term efficacy of mentoring strategies and institutional transformation efforts for WOC. These numerous challenges cumulatively undermine institutions' abilities to implement institutional transformation that impacts WOC in higher education.Originality/value The recommendations provided are based on the results of the meta-analysis and are intended to promote systemic change for STEM WOC faculty in institutions through intersectional and transformational approaches.

AB	The aim of our study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on low sexual interest/arousal of peri- and post-menopausal women. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that published up to 22 June 2016 were retrieved from several online electronic databases, including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, Medline, CINHAL, and EBSCO. Fifty-seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that both pharmacological interventions (mean difference (MD) = -0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.49 to -0.90, p = 0.0001) and non-pharmacological interventions (MD = -0.92, 95% CI = -1.35 to -0.49, p = 0.0001) had statistically significant effects on improving sexual interest/arousal. Among pharmacological interventions, hormone therapy with dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, tibolone and estrogen in combination with progesterone, estrogen in combination with testosterone as well as estrogen in combination with progesterone and testosterone were found to be effective. Non-hormonal medications including flibanserin and sildenafil as well as herbal medicines were also shown to be effective. However, due to high heterogeneity of the findings and scarcity of the studies in certain domains, there is uncertainty of their true effect. So, further well-designed RCTs with larger samples are required to ascertain the long-term effects of studies.

AB	This study aims to analyze the scientific production, in the English and Portuguese languages, about showrooming and webrooming behaviors. A bibliometric study, with a mixed approach, was carried out with a search on Portal de Periodicos CAPES, EBSCO e Google Scholar, and a systematic review of the literature. Despite the fact that the publications on the subject are in a growing, no selected research studied Brazilian consumers. It was also noted that the showrooming behavior is more analyzed than the webrooming. With the objective of supporting researchers who aim to investigate these behaviors, the present research generated a synthesis table of the main results and gaps found in the literature on the subject. The survey of scientific research on this theme facilitates the signaling of theoretical gaps, aiding the advancement of them. For example, some of the gaps founded are the analysis of the role of mobile technologies, the triangulation of different perspectives, and the comparative analysis between results of studies on showrooming and webrooming. The proposed objective is considered pertinent to the current theme and the impact it causes on organizations, being the first study of the type to be carried out.

AB	Libraries have adopted web scale discovery services with the goal of providing their users with a streamlined research experience. However, the single search box that characterizes web scale discovery is one option among many that libraries continue to provide, including subject databases and other legacy tools. Libraries lack evidence regarding which of these tools are best suited to the various stages and levels of expertise that may characterize a user's research process. A case study approach, focusing on the field of academic history, is employed to test the discoverability of a subset of scholarly work across several search platforms.

AB	Objective: Cyberbullying has been drawing the attention of the scientific community. Therefore, nowadays, there is a greater concern on the part of political groups towards this subject which is a public health matter. This systemic literature review aims to understand the approach of primary health care in the identification and prevention of cyberbullying in children/youth. Methods: Following descriptors Cyberbullying, Child, Adolescent, Nurse, and Primary Health Care with Boolean operator AND/NOT in the databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and EBSCO). The articles between 2013 and 2018 were taken into account, with the summary and full text. Results: Sixty-three articles were identified. Twenty-three articles were duplicates, and eleven articles were periodicals of scientific journals. After reading comprehensively, twenty-four articles were eliminated, and only five met the inclusion criteria. Conclusions: Information and Communication Technologies have benefits and disadvantages, with the significant family/person and the nurses play a primary role in the prevention and anticipation of risk behaviors for the overall development of the child/youth. The present Systemic Literature Review alerts for a greater investment in the training of health professionals, providing them with evaluation and intervention strategies to prevent Cyberbullying, identifying victims and aggressors in all contexts (school, family, primary health care, and emergency). Since no studies were found in Europe, more research is suggested to better understand the positive promotion of child/youth care and the family facing Cyberbullying.

We develop a narrative review in stages as follows: a) search question b) bibliographic search, c) recovery of studies without design limits, d) systematization of data, e) choice of studies, f) primary analysis, and g) evaluation and final thematic analysis. Databases such as Annual Reviews, Cambridge Collection, EBSCO, Academic One File Unique, Emmerald, Global Issues in Context, Informe Academico, Ingenta Connect, Jstor, Eric, Lippincott Williams & Wolkins, ProQuest, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Wiley and SciELO, were consulted in English, Portuguese and Spanish, with deadline June 2016, after validation of the descriptors of DeCS Health Sciences. 33 documents were identified, in which ethnography, grounded theory, and discourse analysis were the most used designs. Six studies do not report design. The interview is the most used technique combined with observation and participant observation. Findings show that qualitative methods are the most frequent instruments of research used in studies of emotions in men.

AB	The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to ascertain whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) can be successfully used in non-Western contexts and demonstrate sufficient effectiveness. This area is largely under-researched with conflicting evidence presented in quantitative studies, with virtually no qualitative studies published. This review utilized realist review methodology and focused on qualitative case studies presented by clinicians. A systematic search of EBSCO HOST, The Cochrane Library Database, Google, Google Scholar and reference mining, using various combinations of terms relating to: (1) CBT, (2) social anxiety and (3) cultural diversity were employed. Seven case studies of cultural adaptations of CBT treatment for culturally diverse SAD sufferers were included. The treatment outcomes were generally promising in all cases (reporting significant decrease of SAD symptoms, maintained over time) and the success of therapy was often attributed to culturally specific modifications introduced. CBT can be an acceptable and effective treatment for culturally diverse SAD sufferers with 'modest' modifications, without major diversions from the original CBT models and protocols, but this finding must be treated with caution and more methodologically rigorous research (qualitative and quantitative) is needed to more fully understand what works, for whom and in what circumstances.

AB	Problem Statement: Although Podcast-Learning (PL) represents opportunities to innovative learning, evidence of its effectiveness is still scarce. Research Questions: (1) Which Podcast Practices in Higher Education (HE) foster its effectiveness and (2) How do HE students react to Podcast Learning. Purpose of the Study: A podcast is a media file which can be downloaded and studies found that HE students think Podcasting is more effective than traditional methods. This paper aims to do a systematic literature review of Podcast Learning effectiveness in European HE. Research Methods: The first search was conducted using Ebsco, Redalyc, Scielo, Latindex and B-On databases, which resulted in the identification of 2 publications. Secondly, search was extended to Google Scholar which retrieved 18 publications. Peer-reviewed articles and book sections (all years/countries) with data on effectiveness of Podcast Learning in HE-Europe were included and, Thesis, Books and extra-European research were excluded. Findings: Twenty publications were retrieved and, after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, three were included in the review. Findings suggest that there is a high level of satisfaction with podcasts. Students find podcasts useful and motivating, specially to received feedback and assignments instructions, and data indicates that podcast learning improves student performance in evaluations. Conclusions: Overall, research on PL Effectiveness in HE in Europe is rare. Limitation of this study includes languages and databases used. Nevertheless, this review points to positive results of the use of podcasts in HE which represents an opportunity to adopt this new technique in order to further advance HE.

AB	Mobile applications and smartphones are closely related to each other. Mobile application plays a crucial role among smartphone users. It has gained enormous support from the smartphone users ranging from young to elder generations. It is very common to download and install desired mobile applications from application store to aid in completing particular tasks with ease. However, this behavior exposes user towards privacy risk as it has become a concern in smartphone usage. In this research, we propose a mathematical model named Privacy Risk Model (PRiMo) that measures the risk score of a user in smartphone usage. We are approaching the privacy issues in mobile applications from the individual's perspective. We conduct studies on different categories of mobile applications to determine the risk posed by the mobile applications. There is no standardization for residual risk. Therefore, by using the proposed model, we are exploring and creating a standardization for residual risk that becomes a benchmark for user to accept and live with that risk. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB	Research on deaf and hearing children's academic achievement demonstrates that deaf children whose level of hearing loss is greater than moderate show a delay in mathematics achievement comparing with hearing students [1]. Studies from cognitive science and educational research have been focused on language (e.g. phonological abilities) to find answers regarding deaf student' academic underachievement in order to explore new ways of giving deaf students access to mathematics but it is not been productive enough [2]. For instance, deaf students with cochlear implants still lag behind hearing students even when having more access to language. Using a Systematic Literature Review on the last two decades, this study aims to synthesize the information about the cognitive foundations of mathematics learning of deaf students. More specifically, what are the cognitive abilities differences between deaf and hearing learners (and among deaf learners). We were able to identify 22 relevant publications EBSCO database with the descriptors "deaf", "cognitive", "achievement" and "mathematics". The domain-general cognitive abilities likely to influence learning outcomes for deaf students are related not only with language. Domain-general cognitive abilities such as memory or inhibition control) are also considered in this literature review. Results show that working memory and executive functioning were significantly lower on deaf students comparing with hearing students. Although some studies indicate poorer visual-spatial memory between the two groups, further studies found no significant differences between deaf and hearing students. These inconsistent findings indicate that deaf students may perform as well or better than hearing students in a variety of visual-spatial tasks. This literature review analysis also indicate that deaf students performed less on verbal and nonverbal memory tasks comparing with hearing students, especially when the information is presented sequentially. Other studies focused on numerical cognition show that the delay in mathematics does not appear when non-symbolic number representations tasks are used. On the contrary, non-symbolic number representations are stronger in deaf students than hearing students. Concerning symbolic number representations tasks, studies indicate that deaf children have lower performance in abstract counting and symbolic addition and subtraction problems tasks. The association between these cognitive foundations of mathematics learning on deaf students will be discussed with further detail. This study is included on a research project which explores the impact of an educational/serious videogame on deaf children ' mathematics learning.

AB	1. INTRODUCTION, GAPS, AND OBJECTIVESDecades of environmental degradation have contributed to transitioning the sustainability discourse from the scientific and technological (Ioannidis and Chalvatzis 2017; Pappas et al. 2018) to the public and corporate domains. Within this context, stakeholders aim to control and mitigate environmental degradation represent wide-ranging institutions and organisations (Goworek et al. 2018; Kumar 2016). Among them, corporate organisations are under pressure to implement strategies that will lead to improved environmental and business performance, which have attracted strong attention in the marketing/management field (Tollin and Christensen 2019). This is particularly true in an international business context, where due to growing globalization trends, firms have to demonstrate responsible citizenship for sustainability not only in their home market, but also in host countries. However, sustainability has been conceptualized in a relatively vague way by researchers, which, coupled with the great diversity of its drivers and outcomes (Chalvatzis et al. 2018) reported by the sizable literature in the field, causes confusion in promoting best practice and advancing theory (Eccles, Ioannou, and Serafeim 2012). In light of these problems, there is a need to systematically review and assess the extant body of research on the antecedents and performance outcomes of international environmental marketing/management strategies. In doing so, our review intents to: (a) identify and analyse the theoretical background of this line of research; (b) assess the research methodologies employed by previous empirical studies; (c) identify and assimilate the key thematic areas and specific topics addressed by prior research; and (d) identify the key variables used in the existing literature (e) develop an agenda for future research on the subject.2. METHODOLOGYA two-stage process was adopted for the present review: article identification and article analysis. In order to identify the initial pool of articles, we adopted the concept-driven systematic review method approach (Webster and Watson 2002). To accumulate a complete census of relevant literature and build the initial pool of studies, articles with relevant topics were searched in various electronic databases, such as Ebsco, Scopus and Science Direct, which provide a comprehensive coverage with full access. We have used the following keywords to identify relevant articles: environmental marketing; environmental strategy; green marketing; environmentally friendly; sustainable marketing; natural environment; environmental orientation; environmental proactivity; environmental awareness; and environmental management. This was done in conjunction with international-related keywords, namely multinational firms; global corporations; global consumers; international marketing; cross-cultural marketing; and cross-national marketing. These keywords were identified from previous reviews on the subject and were refined by two established scholars in the field. We searched these pre-defined keywords in article title, author supplied keywords, and author supplied abstract. We limited our search to articles published in English in academic peer-reviewed journals, since the inception of this field of research in the early 1960s. This initial search from the various electronic databases yielded 949 articles, of which 498 had to be removed because of being duplicated while another 167 were found irrelevant after carefully screening the title and the abstract.2.1 Article identificationWe critically appraised the full text of the remaining 284 potentially relevant articles, by taking into consideration the following four criteria with regard to the studies contained: (1) to be published in an academic journal rather than a book, book chapters or conference proceedings; (2) to focus on environmental marketing/management strategies as an independent concept, rather than as a sub-dimension of Corporate Social Responsibility; (3) to be of an international nature, by examining the sustainability strategies of firms (e.g., exporters, MNEs, etc.) when crossing their national boundaries; and (4) to have empirical nature, with papers having a conceptual, methodological, review, or meta-analytical nature being excluded. Only 68 articles met these pre-defined selection criteria, which were subsequently examined by two academic experts in order to verify their appropriateness. The outcome of this process was to exclude another seven articles. We have carefully reviewed the reference lists of the 61 articles that passed the cross check, revealing another 34 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria set, thus bringing the final sample of articles useful for the review to 95.2.2 Article analysisTo map research on the antecedents and outcomes of environmental marketing/management strategy within the international marketing context, we proceeded with a content analysis of the selected articles. In doing so, we have designed a coding frame incorporating publication details, theories undertaken located mainly in developed economies with less attention paid on emerging and developing economies. The majority of the reviewed studies had a particular focus on manufacturing industries where there are studies where multiple industries are included which allows for examination of industry type control effects. More recent studies start to examine other industries such as energy, tourism, transportation, and other service industries. The vast majority of the research is undertaken using primary data and few studies used secondary ESG data sourced by national or third-party institutions. The articles were classified into six broad thematic categories and multiple sub-categories such as (1) energy efficiency; (2) water conversation; (3) green supply chain management; (4) waste management; (5) product/ service eco- friendliness; and (6) emissions reduction.3.2 Study ImplicationsBased on the thematic clustering undertaken, we developed an integrative framework for environmental marketing and management practices and a coherent agenda for future research directions. The systematic review confirms that managers might adopt environmentally friendly marketing/ management strategy as a means of increasing their performance. Competences such knowledge, systems and routines developed within the company are found to stimulate a proactive environmental strategy which research has shown that can enhance different performance outcomes.

AB	The study analyzes the concept of transnational learning in the context of professional development for teachers. The aim of the study is to theoretically reflect on transnational learning as a tool for the multi-dimensional professional development of teachers in the 21st century.One of the goals defined by UNESCO to be reached by the year 2030, is improved quality of education and lifelong learning, including teacher professional development. Teacher Professional Development Forms develop and change both vertically and horizontally, from passive to active solution search, experience-based learning.The study examines the professional growth of adults in 3 different theories: Kegan constructive-developmental theory, Drago- Seversone learning-oriented model for school leadership and Nonaka and Takeuchi SECI organizational knowledge creation theory. The authors' conclusions on transnational learning as a tool for teacher professional development are based on the findings of, Bruno-Jofre, and Johnston, as well as Johnson and OECD. As well as researching previous studies on transnational learning available on the Ebsco and Web of science websites.Methodology: In the process of research, using the method of analysis of scientific literature, conclusions have been drawn on the transnational learning role in the professional development of teachers.

AB	Blended learning is now being widely experimented with for the purposes of enhancing the education process, especially when it comes to leaning foreign languages. The presence and development of many an application on the market makes the prospect of digitalization of education ever more appealing. However, at the end of the day, whether this availability is likely to be enough to make students more motivated to study on their own or not is the question.The purpose of the article is to compare the more recent experiment which took place at Ural Federal University, Ekaterinburg, Russia with the use of the online platform Rosetta Stone, offered by EBSCO Company with the findings of the previously conducted experiment using Touchstone. The participants of the former three-month experiment were level A2 (CEFR) first-year STEM students, divided into three groups: 1. traditional teaching or control groups (N=35), 2. blended groups where in the classroom students had traditional interactive lessons and they did their homework on the Rosetta Stone platform (N=35), and 3. experimental groups, with Rosetta Stone online both in the classroom and at home (N=35). The latter one included 75 students STEM students of A1-A2 levels (CEFR). Special emphasis is laid on students' motivation, the initial hypothesis being that students will be more engaged in a course featuring modern interactive technologies. Yet, the results show that less control of the course completion from the teacher (authoritarian vs democratic approach) led to the decline in student's productivity. Moreover, some of the shortcomings of the course are covered.

AB	Nowadays mobile devices and applications are a crucial part of the studying process. The important role of the mobile technologies in the classroom and e-learning as a platform for teaching and studying is difficult to overestimate. The application of these devices into everyday teaching seems a sensible way of motivating students and use their skills in learning English as a foreign language. On the other hand, online learning helps motivate students to do their homework. The hypothesis being that students will make progress quicker if mobile learning is used. The online platform used for this experiment was Rosetta Stone, offered by EBSCO Company.The aim of the article is to describe the experiment which took place at Ural Federal University, Ekaterinburg, Russia, and to present its results paying special attention to the development of the listening skills. The participants of the three-month experiment were level A2 first-year STEM students. All of them were divided into three groups: 1. traditional teaching or control groups (N=35), 2. blended groups where in the classroom students had traditional interactive lessons and they did their homework on the Rosetta Stone platform (N=35), and 3. experimental groups, with Rosetta Stone online both in the classroom and at home (N=35). All the participants were from various University Departments (Chemistry, Biology, IT) and were taught by different teachers to ensure the validity of the results. The students were initially tested with DIALANG Test, and having completed the course, they were tested again to see the progress or the lack of thereof. The students' motivation was not taken into account since English is a must and all of them had to learn it. While taking part in the experiment, the participants had mock-Cambridge English: Key tests every month evaluating the development of such skills as Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing. This article highlights the results of the online learning when developing the listening skills as well as the prospects and limitations of the mobile learning.

AB	Previous research studies had revealed that truant students have a greater tendency to be delinquent. Since non-attendance is a family and school related behaviour, it could be presumed that parents and teachers factors perform a key part in the incidence of truant behaviour in schools. This paper aims at identifying both causative and preventive role parents and teachers play on students' truant behaviour. The database used to get key words for this paper includes; EBSCO Host, Social Work Abstracts, ERIC, Academic Search Premier, SocINDEX and Goggle search engines. The researcher took enough time to explore the literature review of the origin of truancy, concept of truancy, theories which explain truant behaviour. Furthermore, prevalence of truancy globally, parents and teachers' causatives roles on truant behaviour, parents and teacher's preventive roles on truant behaviour were also discussed. Having found the causative and preventive role parents and teachers played on student's truant behaviour, it was recommended, among others, that parent and teachers should identify ways in which they have contributed to their wards truant behaviour and ensure that they look for appropriate techniques that will prevent the reoccurrence of such acts.

AB	One of the most popular game types is card strategy game (collectible card game), which is a game of collecting and trading cards games. The card pictures vary from cartoon, fantasy to magical hero characters. This game can also be played by custom game rules and individual strategies. This means it is not only limited to collecting the cards. Collectible card games are usually played manually without a computer system. That is why "Battle Drone" was created. This is a card strategy game that has been computer-based. Battle Drone is a type of game focused on card selection strategies and chance of victory. Development methods are based on game development life cycle consisting of analysis, game design, implementation, and testing. A computer-based card strategy game that uses a barcode system to summon monsters and use ability from game card into console game.

AB	Imagine a large firm with multiple departments that plans a large recruitment. Candidates arrive one-by-one, and for each candidate the firm decides, based on her data (CV, skills, experience, etc), whether to summon her for an interview. The firm wants to recruit the best candidates while minimizing the number of interviews. We model such scenarios as an assignment problem between items (candidates) and categories (departments): the items arrive one-by-one in an online manner, and upon processing each item the algorithm decides, based on its value and the categories it can be matched with, whether to retain or discard it (this decision is irrevocable). The goal is to retain as few items as possible while guaranteeing that the set of retained items contains an optimal matching.We consider two variants of this problem: (i) in the first variant it is assumed that the n items are drawn independently from an unknown distribution D. (ii) In the second variant it is assumed that before the process starts, the algorithm has an access to a training set of n items drawn independently from the same unknown distribution (e.g. data of candidates from previous recruitment seasons). We give near-optimal bounds on the best-possible number of retained items in each of these variants. These results demonstrate that one can retain exponentially less items in the second variant (with the training set).Our algorithms and analysis utilize ideas and techniques from statistical learning theory and from discrete algorithms.

AB	Introduction: Psychopedagogical evaluation is a process of data collection, analysis and interpretation, in order to develop explanatory models of the phenomenon of teaching and learning. This evaluation is based on the principle that subjects who are immersed in academic processes have their own unique conditions and their own personal, family and school stories.Methodology A systematic review of psychopedagogical evaluation was carried out. The search and selection criteria required that the articles be in English and Spanish, be a related to qualitative research and have been published between 2010 and 2018 in the following databases: EBSCO, Dialnet Plus, ProQuest (Social Sciences and Psychology), Redalyc, Jstor and Scielo.Instruments: To evaluate the methodological quality of the compiled investigations, the "Framework for Assessing Qualitative Evaluations" of the National Center for Social Research was employed, validated by two research experts.Results: 22 studies that met the quality criteria were reviewed. The investigations were mostly developed in Spain. It was found that the issues, commonly associated with psychopedagogical evaluation, are with regards to learning and learning difficulties, classroom evaluation, special needs education, intellectual disability or high intellectual abilities, design of intervention programs, school or educational orientation, inclusive education, diagnosis, cognitive processes or cognitive functions, family participation, school failure and interdisciplinarity. The instruments most used for the collection of information were bibliographic matrices for documentary research, interviews (structured and semi-structured) and some standardized tests.Conclusion: There is a notable growth in scientific and professional interest in psychopedagogical evaluation in the Spanish-speaking world, mainly led by Spain. However, the context and the country's needs are different compared to those of Latin America. Therefore, it is recommended that professionals in the area perform research to understand psychopedagogy in all its forms and research paradigms, under a Latin American context.

AB	The Google search shows the bibliometric boom. On April 6, 2016 for a query, word "bibliometric" the result was 458,000 units. The search for the phrase "bibliometric analysis" gave about 222,000 units. The same search on July 22, 2019 gave 1,720,000 and 1,420,000 units, accordingly. The similar search with the Scopus database indicates a trend of growing interest to bibliometrics by researchers (including representatives of economic science).My report contains the following sections:1 A brief information of concerning origination of bibliometrics and its development ("Arthashastra", the links with ancient libraries, the works of ancient thinkers of China, Greece, and Rome, as well as of medieval Europe, the classification boom in the middle of the XIX century, the role of Eugene Garfield, etc.).2 The data of publication on bibliometric (the absolute and relative numbers of publications in Web of Science, Scopus, EconLit) in general and in economics and management. These data indicate that the bibliometric analysis in specific areas or types of economic research was prevailing: e.g. in the development of the individual subject areas (finance, history of thought, etc.), statistical analysis of articles in specific scientific journals, and others.3 The beginning of bibliometric analysis at the Faculty of Economics at the Novosibirsk State University in collaboration with the Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Here I, as a founder and organizer, show two directions with examples of our publications. The first direction concerns the separate subject areas: energy economics, agricultural economics, financial economics, accounting, regional economics, entrepreneurship, innovation, government policy and regulation, environmental economics, higher economic education. The second direction lays a stress on system bibliometric analysis. Here I consider our books in English and Russian "Analysis of the scientific publication structure in economics" and "Atlas of Publications in Economics on the EconLit Basis. 1992-2005".4 This is a key section, which is devoted to the premises and realization of the project "Atlas of new research based on EconLit (2006-2013)" in 19 volumes. This is a part of series of digital books "Innovative Bibliometric Analysis in Economics". Each volume is devoted to one of the general categories of JEL subject classification and contains a set of tables. These tables include the collection of bibliometric indicators that characterize the changes in JEL general categories in 2006-2013 from the point of view 20 macro, 127 meso, and 822 micro categories. The main achievement consists in presentation of new research on the intersections of the JEL subject micro categories with bibliographic information and abstracts concerning the first works on the new intersections.5 This section describes the usage of our methods and EconLit, and the other bibliometric tools and databases (Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, SSRN, etc.) in the obligatory courses for the undergraduate and graduate students at the Novosibirsk State University. A special significance is payed to application of bibliometrics in dissertations and economic research.

TI	INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OF PRIMARY SCHOOLCHILDREN AND THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT ENCOURAGING AUTONOMY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY

AB	The article aims to reveal and theoretically substantiate the interrelationship between the physical activity of primary schoolchildren and the school environment that encourages autonomy. The study reveals the concept of physical activity, and highlights the links between the sustainability of an autonomous environment and children's physical activity by applying the basic principles of the self-determination theory. The sources that analyse the peculiarities of the physical activity of primary schoolchildren, the provisions of the theory of self-determination and their application while studying children's physical activity in the school context were searched for in the databases Pubmed, EBSCO, Google Scholar, and the electronic catalogue of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. The keyword combinations used for the search were "physical activity", "primary schoolchildren", "middle childhood", "motivation", "self-determination theory", "school physical activity interventions". The criteria for selecting articles were the following: 1) the studies of the features characteristic to the middle childhood period were carried out in the context of the self-determination theory; 2) the research on children's physical activity was conducted in the school environment and based on the provisions of the self-determination theory; 3) the results of quantitative and qualitative research were provided. One of the basic principles of the self-determination theory is that individuals are more likely to engage in the activities they feel self-motivated for, i.e. the activities that an individual starts voluntarily and not those he/she feels to be controlled. While sustaining autonomous motivation, various social contextual conditions are crucial, and they make an impact through responding to three major psychological needs - autonomy, competence and communication. Autonomy is the main concept of the self-determination theory, and it is recognized to be a key factor while encouraging the internal motivation for greater physical activity of children. Given that children spend about half of their time at school, it is the school that is identified to be one of the most important contexts for children's autonomy and physical activity. An autonomous environment is mainly created through the interaction and communication between the teacher and the schoolchild and his/her peers. From the perspective of the child's development, in the period of the middle childhood, the teacher is perceived as the authority; therefore, the behaviour of teachers and the educational practices applied have a major impact on children's participation in physical activities. Thus, both the teacher and the peers form the social context for the physical activeness and are independent variables in motivational processes. Teachers' educational practices, as well as the educational conditions that meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and sustained interrelationship, can successfully strengthen internal motivation and improve achievements. The quality of schoolchildren's relationships with their closest friends and the extent to which they feel recognized by their peers in physical education classes also have a positive effect on their motivation. To sum up, to promote the physical activity of primary schoolchildren, it is important to create an environment that encourages children's autonomy through good relationships between the teacher and the child as well as through the relationship among the schoolchildren.

AB	For nearly three years the Colorado Library Consortium (CLiC) has been accused as a "purveyor of pornography" for its cooperative purchasing services - licensing resources from EBSCO, Gale/Cengage, ProQuest and OverDrive - saving money on behalf of libraries and schools across the state. In October 2018 a lawsuit was filed against EBSCO and CLiC by the parents of a student who claimed that their middle-school-aged child was able to access, "hardcore porn" through the school district's database subscription. This first-person account details how the controversy began and evolved into a full-scale crusade to ban digital content in Colorado's schools and public libraries.

AB	Purpose: The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been changing since its creation. As the concept has been evolving, new definitions were born, and academics and practitioners have changed their focus over the years. In this paper longitudinal studies dealing with online CSR communication are reviewed to explore general tendencies and patterns.Design/methodology/approach: In order to find longitudinal studies on online CSR communication within EBSCO Database related papers were sought. In addition, a further investigation was made with Google Scholar search engine to find more relevant papers about online CSR communication. At the end of the search process, 7 articles were identified. The selected longitudinal studies together cover a period between 2003 and 2017.Findings: The longitudinal analyses that were selected used similar research methodologies. All studies applied a content analysis where researchers were looking for predefined keywords and categories on corporate websites. Findings suggest, that communicating about CSR activities and principles on corporate websites is evident for larger companies in the western world, and it is becoming the norm in other parts of the world as well. The salience of different CSR topics on the websites, however, has been changing, and there are no constant key themes that would have been dominated the online CSR disclosure in the last 15 years.Research/practical implications: By analyzing longitudinal studies researchers and practitioners may have deeper insights about (online) CSR communication, and they can predict future tendencies of the field.Originality/value: Although research on internet-based CSR communication is abundant, longitudinal studies are rare. To the best knowledge of the author, this paper presents the first attempt to perform a comprehensive review of these studies.

AB	This study aim to review the past studies to highlight the most frequently used green human resource management practices (GHRM) in the literature. Further, it also proposes the green health, wealth and security as an important GHRM practice to improve the environmental performance of the organizations. Systematic literature review was used to acknowledge the past literature of a decade and total 49 studies as a sample were included in this study. The previous studies were taken from the JSTOR, PROQUEST, EBSCO, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Emerald, Elsevier and Springer with the combination of keywords. Findings reveal that GHRM practices are extensively used to enhance the environmental performance of the organizations and most frequently used practices were green training & development, green recruitment & selection, green reward and compensation. Human resource department is an active partner to initiate and adopt green practices to meet the stakeholder's pressure. Analysis of data also highlighted the GHRM scholarship which stills remained due to GHRM infancy stage. Systematic literature review on GHRM suggest that organizations can get benefit by offering motivating factors for employees to adopt green HRM policies and practices that help to enhance organizational and environmental performance. This study highlighted the gaps which exist in the literature of GHRM and are important factor for both developed and developing countries as well as specifically for those countries which are higher in producing greenhouse gases.

AB	Inspite of Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country, so rare ulema is modeled as a successful figure in applying entrepreneurship from an Islamic perspective. This paper is to describe how Guru Sekumpul becomes an exemplary model as he was successful for the concept in dakwah as well as develops economic base benefitted the community. Using qualitative methods, interview was conducted among people who have been closed with the master to find out how the master accumulated wealth without neglecting the principle of Islamic entrepreneurship. The result of observation revealed that delivering a very interesting summon, practicing what is preached and archiving the thought by written works, had become the keys to create a path for economic growth and development of society for entrepreneurship based religion. The model applied by the prominent ulema may become another reference disseminating all over the region for those interested in applying EIP.

Web of Science Core Collection (WoS CC), including Emerging Sources Citation Index, Scopus and Russian Index of Science Citation, as well as Russian Science Citation Index, EBSCO, LISA. About fifty Russian journals in these disciplines are revealed. The authors emphasize their insufficient coverage by the science citation databases. They suggest the following reasons for this situation: the limited number of journals in the library and information studies, non-compliance with formal requirements of citation databases, low quality of publications. The authors formulate the measures to improve the situation: to comply with international standards, to improve their quality so they could compete to foreign journals, as the international database generators and experts use international standards to select science journals for indexing.

AB	This study attempts to use the principles of Bradford's law to determine the core concepts of information and communication technologies (ICTs) research within the information and knowledge management (IKM) research. Data were obtained from EBSCO Discovery Service's, Library Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA) and the Library and Information Science Source (LISS), using a variety of keywords as search terms. The procedures for conducting a Bradford analysis were followed to determine the core ICTS subject terms within IKM research published between 1998 and 2017. The results indicate that the core subjects varied from one study period to another; multi-disciplinarity of subject terms was highly visible; and the dispersion of subject terms fits Bradford's law of dispersion. However, the dispersion of articles according to Bradford's zones is not accurately representative of the principles of this law. The study has implications for curriculum development, thesaurus construction, literature research, collection development, development of an information system and subject organisation and description. The findings have implications on the application of Bradford's law beyond the analysis of core journals or publications in a field.

AB	Academic libraries have increasingly adopted web-scale discovery tools in order to meet the expectations of students who want immediate results, efficient algorithms, and a single search box. As they have become the de facto search tool at many libraries, librarians and patrons alike have been forced to confront the way they think about research processes and in some cases, modulate ingrained habits. In this article, the authors explore student perceptions of efficacy, relevancy, and ease of use of a library discovery tool through a 2017 mixed-methods user experience study conducted at three City University of New York (CUNY) campuses. The results from this user study will be useful to other institutions that already have implemented discovery layers within their library and help inform website design, discovery layer design, and pedagogy. By combining student interviews with a task analysis, the authors were able to learn more about student search behaviors, how they respond to challenges, and what they expect from search tools. Identifying these barriers to student use of the Primo discovery tool has helped us articulate best practices for instruction and interface customization that may address these barriers and has illuminated implications for website integration.

AB	Effective collaboration between archives and technical services can increase the discoverability of special collection materials. Archivists at the University of Dayton Libraries began using Archive-It to capture websites relevant to their collecting policies in 2015. However, the collections were only made available to users from the University of Dayton page on the Archive-It website. Content was isolated in a separate platform and was not promoted to users. Working together, the team of archivists and technical services librarians incorporated the web archive collections into the Libraries' EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) discovery layer. A local data dictionary was created based on OCLC's Descriptive Metadata for Web Archiving report (2018), and metadata was added at the seed and collection levels. The result was indexed content on a single, user-friendly platform. The web archive collections were then marketed to the University of Dayton community, and statistics were generated on their use.

It was created by the multidisciplinary team of the Centre du Langage of the child and adolescent psychopathology service of the Avicenne Hospital in Bobigny (Ile de France-France). The test responds to the growing need of medical, social and educational professionals to have a tool that allows them to evaluate and enhance the language skills in mother tongue of multilingual children. L'ELAL d'Avicenne evaluates universally acquired simple concepts before the age of 6 years 5 month, which makes it accessible to children between the ages of 3 years 5 month to 6 years 5 month. The study aims to present the process of translation of a transcultural test in Italian and to present the final product: the test L'ELAL d'Avicenne translated into Italian. The translation process consists of two levels: 1. translation of the original version of the test into Italian and, 2. its application to a sample of 20 monolingual Italian children in a context where Italian is the predominant mother tongue. The final results highlight an inferential equivalence of the original and the final version of the test L'ELAL d'Avicenne in Italian for every step: production, understanding and production of a story.

AB	The authors consider the existence of an energy transfer system (ETS) in the human body and its consequences for health, performing a review of the available literature and studies. The article is an attempt to describe the possible psychophysiological mechanism of ETS (i.e. mechanism of transmission of stimuli in connective tissue) based on biochemical reactions, which was first described in Eastern Medicine a long time ago. Some previously reported results suggest that it is possible to modulate the psychophysiological effects on the connective tissue, and that the internal ETS can be activated not only through internal acupoints but also through breath self-regulation techniques. Among the people specialized in such breathing are martial art fighters. In a very preliminary pilot study we investigate four cases in a Vietnamese Thien Mon Dao (TMD) group, where breathing techniques result in cardiovascular and blood pressure changes, which can indirectly suggest activation of ETS. An additional energy system in the human body is postulated. However, future research is seriously needed. Findings could be applicable e.g. in cardiac rehabilitation programs.

AB	Leadership has become a vital research field in management science. Research shows that leadership is a complex phenomenon which has led to a substantial amount of studies in the past to improve the understanding of this research field. Literature and empirical studies addressing leadership reveal that research is still fragmented and studies are not conducted in a uniform framework. This leads to the fact that research results are partly comparable due to different definitions and interpretations. In recent years, transformational and transactional leadership gained attention by several scholars. In brief, transformational leadership stimulates and enhances the performance of the followers. In this respect, the leader transforms and motives the subordinates to achieve higher organizational goals by embodying a role model. In addition, the leader becomes a mentor by considering the individual needs and wants. Consequently, this fosters creativity and individuals consider their work as essential. In contrast, transactional leadership conveys clear goals and structures which are based on an exchange model. Therefore, the employees are obliged to follow the instructions to achieve the company goals. Moreover, the subordinates do not have the allowance to make own decisions. In case of deviations, the superior takes corrective measures. The aim of this paper is to identify indicators for measuring transformational and transactional leadership in order to offer a uniform research framework. The author performs content analyses to evaluate the current state of science to identify indicators for measuring transformational and transactional leadership. To gain a holistic view, the author uses scientific books and databases such as Emerald, Springer Link, EBSCO, ScienceDirect, Sage Journals, JSTOR and Taylor and Francis. The preliminary research results show that numerous indicators describe transformational and transactional leadership which contribute to the theoretical and practical implications in leadership research.

AB	This article addresses the Syrian regime's strategic communication as a practice of politics that runs hand in hand with its repressive political, social, and military tactics to control the political sphere, win the ongoing civil war in the country, and violently suppress its opponents since the Syrian uprising began in March 2011. Drawing on primary and secondary sources as well as discourse analysis of Syrian President Bashar al- Assad's main speeches since 2011, the article suggests that this strategy is a dynamic practice of politics that combines the mobilization of media and cultural genres as technologies of power with a political language rooted in the Ba'ath Party's ideology to legitimate the regime's war against its opponents, ensure support, and summon citizens as political subjectivities.

AB	Objective - To examine trends in digital object identifier (DOI) web referrals and explore the referring domains, especially those originating from web-scale discovery systems like ProQuest's Summon and Primo.Design - Log analysis and web traffic analysis.Setting - CrossRef, a web server that connects DOIs to the corresponding articles' landing pages.Subjects - Web traffic that passed through CrossRef between 2011 and 2016.Methods - The researchers collected data from CrossRef using a web tool called Chronograph. The data captured information about the websites users were on when they requested a DOI (called the referrer) and about the time and date of each request.The researchers used time series analysis to discover longitudinal patterns in the data. Annual, monthly, and weekly trends were also examined with a seasonal adjustment model, a seasonal trend decomposition, and log transformation. They also isolated traffic from four institutions in Australia, Japan, Sweden, and the United States of America to determine if overall seasonal patterns were reflected locally.ProQuest websites were of particular interest to the researchers because they determined that it had the highest market share of discovery services. Much of the analysis focused on ProQuest's serialsolutions.com, exlibrisgroup.com, and proquest.com website domains.Main Results - ProQuest servers sent over 25 million DOI referrals through CrossRef - more than either Web of Knowledge (n=24.47 million) or Google (n=15.38 million).Referral traffic grew over the period with the sharpest growth rate occurring between 2011 and 2012. Of ProQuest's domains, serialsolutions.com (Summon) had more traffic and more growth over the observation period than exlibrisgroup.com (Primo).In all of the years studied, the busiest months were September to November and January to March, while June to August and December were low points. Seasonal fluctuations were attributed to university vacation schedules as demonstrated in the traffic patterns of four ProQuest-subscribing institutions.Weekly trend analysis showed that Monday to Thursday had consistently heavy referral traffic. Of the remaining days, the fewest referrals were observed on Saturdays.Conclusion - DOI referrer traffic is closely tied to the university calendar. Library discovery products are used more frequently to access DOIs than Google.

AB	Although academic library print collections are traditionally carefully selected, collection strategies for online materials often involve the addition of large, uncurated packages of eBooks and other online materials. This study examines how adding such packages has altered the composition of one library's collection in terms of publication date, format, and subject. It then utilizes WebPAC and Summon search results to understand how the collection is experienced by library searchers. Results show rapid growth in uncurated collections. Whereas WebPAC heavily favored newer items and eBooks from uncurated collections, Summon promoted print books from cultivated collections to a degree greater than expected.

To determine when information literacy instruction using Summon would be effective and what aspects should be taught, librarians conducted a usability study. Students completed tasks focused on determining whether Summon is intuitive and whether the interface needs to be taught. Results indicate that students are comfortable with the interface and have few problems with the tool. Instead, participants struggled with critical thinking processes associated with research. Results were used to integrate the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education into instruction.

The academic production about innovation capability of clusters in the business field from 2005 to 2014 was analyzed and the databases consulted were: EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Web of Knowledge -311 items were cataloged, 144 were available in full text, and among those 18 papers were selected. The cluster innovation capability was structured based on a theoretical framework through qualitative content analysis. Thus, acquisition capability, diffusing capability, and knowledge management capability are the main capabilities that constitute the cluster innovation capability.

AB	The objective of the study is to analyze the effect of three dimensional (3D) virtual environment and augmented reality applications on learning achievement. In line with this purpose, experimental studies were considered and the effects of experimental and control groups on learning achievement analyzed. In the experimental group, the applications which were established through the 3D virtual environment and augmented reality technologies while control group consisted of face to face environment. In order to realize this aim, the meta-analysis method used in educational sciences was preferred. Key words for 3D virtual environments meta-analysis scanning are: '''3D virtual world" & achievement' and '''3D virtual environment" & achievement'. And the key word determined for the augmented reality meta- analysis scanning is '''augmented reality" & achievement'. Within the context of the research, the databases such as Science Direct, ERIC, Taylor & Francis, EBSCO, Emerald, JSTOR, SAGE, SpringerLink and Google Scholar were analyzed. The determined keywords were entered into the aforementioned databases and 4.682 articles published between 2010 and 2016 were controlled in terms of their conformity to the objectives of the research. After the initial analysis, 47 articles were determined on 3D virtual environment while 57 articles were on the augmented reality. Among the 47 articles on 3D virtual environments, 20 articles which conform to the inclusion criteria were determined and 24 articles among the 57 articles on augmented reality were employed for meta-analysis. The dependent variable of the research is learning achievement while independent variable is experimental and control groups. Education level was determined as the moderator variable in the research. According to the results of the research, it was found that 3D virtual environments had moderate levels of effect on learning achievement on behalf of the experimental group (d=0.32). similar to those results, augmented reality applications had also moderate level of effect on learning achievement on behalf of experimental group (d=0.46). According to the results of the moderator analysis conducted, it was determined that the selection of the study sample as undergraduate, primary school, high school and secondary school did not change the effect size of the 3D virtual environments on the learning success. Again, according to the results of the moderator analysis, it was determined that the selection of the study sample as a secondary school, primary school and graduate did not change the effect size of the augmented reality applications on the learning success.

AB	The school, also from the architectural and the furniture point of view, is undoubtedly a cultural product typical of every historical period. During Fascism, the school carried out the task of training the citizen-soldier, lover of the country and obedient to the wishes of the "duce". Using massively the art and the beauty, the school has assumed a central role in the fascist State, being charged with the transmission of a national identity based on the cult of those who had died for the construction of the united Italy. Art, in all its forms, but especially the architectural and plastic ones, has been cleverly used in the twenty years of fascism as a tool for the transmission of a pedagogy of death and war, considered essential for the "new Italian". The essay investigates the mechanisms with which the totalitarian fascist aesthetic has been applied in the schools of Turin in the years of the first post-war period, covering an unavoidable part-albeit unsuspected for many-in building the consensus.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish a connection between the business model (BM) and B2B marketing research by developing a new approach to the BM analysis and improvement, which is based on inter-organizational networks and value chains.Design/methodology/approach The methodology is based on mutual enrichment of methods and results of BM and business-to-business marketing studies that are relatively isolated from each other, and on integration of them to the unified structured approach that could be applied to analyze both BM and a set of interfirm relationships of networked market players. This paper is based on extensive literature review in the areas of BM and relationship/industrial marketing. The review is based on most cited and contemporary articles found in the Scopus and EBSCO databases.Findings This paper formulates the key BM research directions and visualizes their development over time. It is demonstrated in the paper that currently, there is little involvement of marketing researchers in the study of BM; however, there are multiple touchpoints between these areas of knowledge, which can help in further developing BM studies. On the basis of these findings, a conceptual model and new network-based approach to BM analysis is offered, which allows addressing the complex nature of networked interaction among BM participants. The approach includes stepwise algorithm for BM analysis designed for business practitioners.Research limitations/implications The proposed approach can be applied by business practitioners to analyze and improve their BM via managing the interactions of inter-organizational network participants with a focus on customer interests. While the approach is of a universal character, the specific tools for evaluating BM on each stage may vary across different markets.Originality/value This research contributes to the current conceptual knowledge on BM studies development and their relationship with marketing. It also contributes to theory and practice by the development of a new marketing-based approach to the BM analysis focused on managing business relationships, which allows evaluation of the current state of a BM and provides directions for its improvement. This approach evaluates the alignment of interfirm relationships along the value chain and orients it toward the final consumer.

AB	As with any shared format for serializing data, Primo's PNX records have limits on the types of data which they pass along from the source records and into the Primo tool. As a result of these limitations, PNX records do not currently have a provision for harvesting and transferring rights information about HathiTrust holdings that the Kansas State University (KSU) Library system indexes through Primo. This created a problem, since Primo was defaulting to indicate that all HathiTrust materials were available to KSU Libraries (K-State Libraries) patrons, when only a limited portion of them actually were. This disconnect was infuriating some library users, and creating difficulties for the public services librarians. There was a library-wide discussion about removing HathiTrust holdings from Primo altogether, but it was decided that such a solution was an overreaction. As a consequence, the library IT department began a crash program to attempt to find a solution to the problem. The result was an application called hathiGenius.

AB	Though culture is closely related to religion, the role of religion has been mainly ignored in the study of entrepreneurship. In spite of Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country, so rare ulema is modeled as a successful figure in applying entrepreneurship from an Islamic perspective. Guru Sekumpul is an exception as he was successful for the concept in dakwah as well as develops economic base benefitted the community. Delivering a very interesting summon, practicing what is preached and archiving the thought by written works become the keys to create a path for economic growth and development of society for entrepreneurship based religion. Applying a qualitative method to gather data for it generates in-depth information, semi-structured interviews with five (5) key informants were conducted. Comprehending that EIP is worship leading to the concept of Guru Sekumpul that believes preaching does not mean begging including sending a budget proposal to other third parties. Thus, Guru Sekumpul finances dakwah with his own money and also distributes money for various social purposes and needs of the poor. At the same time, Guru Sekumpul teamed up trade with worshipers in running a business, entrusted capital, provided capital and motivate the devotees to strive. The understanding of Islamic economics as an arena of worship becomes the starting point of economic development. Thus, the model of dakwah of Guru Sekumpul should be disseminated within the framework of Entrepreneurship from Islamic Perspective (EIP).

AB	This paper provides a meta-analysis of the generalizations in the relationships between the antecedents and consequents of satisfaction with online banking services. In total, 118 observations were analysed, with a sample of 49,607 respondents in 39 published articles from studies indexed in ten databases (Jstor, Emerald, PsycINFO, Taylor & Francis, Elsevier Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, SciELO, Google Scholar and EBSCO). Specifically, for the data analysis, we used the correlation coefficient r (plus chi(2), f test, t test, z test and beta values). The results showed that constructs related to uncertainty, as evoked by online devices, system performance, quality of device content and online banking device structures, are significant and positive antecedents of consumer satisfaction. We also found that satisfaction with online banking services promotes trust and loyalty. Finally, we also detected that the relationship between reliability, satisfaction and service quality is stronger among Western banking consumers.

AB	The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the current literature of this business phenomenon with regard to gender studies and to point out what is substantially happening and what has happened in the Italian economic context. The main research questions were RQ1: How is the phenomenon of female Startups treated from a scientific point of view? RQ2: Which is the Italian situation of this phenomenon? The methodology used is both qualitative and explorative. A bidirectional analysis has been carried out for this purpose. In order to expand the first research question (RQ1), an analysis was carried out of the articles in the EBSCO database on the topic of female startups. In order to expand the second question (RQ2), an analysis was carried out on the data concerning the phenomenon of female startups, using the register of companies held at the Chambers of Commerce which were territorially competent. Our research, carried out within the Italian economic context, demonstrates how the phenomenon of Woman Startups (WSU), even if it is widely expanding, is inherent in all the typical elements of female entrepreneurship, as reported in the literature by gender scholars. The main factors that emerge for the WSU are the small size and the undercapitalization in the startup phase. This work contributes to the expansion of studies on the topic of startups in the context of gender and can be useful to the social context, new entrepreneurs, and practitioners of the sector.

AB	Seeing the dynamic user demands the libraries are changing their approach to the user services. The web-scale discovery (WSD) service is the latest attempt in this direction. There are several players in the marketplace providing solutions for WSD with products having basic features and subtle features as well. As more players are entering the marketplace, it becomes challenging to select appropriate WSD system. It is also paramount for the library managers to be aware of the myriad range of features and underlying technology of WSD. This understanding will be for making informed purchase decisions. This paper attempts to explain in detail the components of a typical WSD system. Further, the paper evaluates the features of the Big 4's in WSD. The paper concludes by discussing some of the parameters to consider while evaluating the WSD system.

AB	Background: Aging has been associated with a loss of strength, muscle mass and physical function known as sarcopenia', which is associated with a high incidence of accidental falls observed among the elderly that can compromise their quality of life. Different studies suggest that blood flow restriction training (BFR) in combination with low loads can increase strength and muscle mass in older people and be a more comfortable and tolerable training for this population than training with high loads. However, the effects of this training system on older adults remains unclear. Objective: To determine the effect of BFR training on strength, muscle mass and physical function on older adults. Method: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies were identified via electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Lilacs and EBSCO) based on the following inclusion criteria: (a) Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of BFR training on strength, muscle mass and physical function on older adults; (b) participants of 60 years of age or over, trials that included younger participants were included if the mean age minus one standard deviation is more than 58 years. Three comparisons were made for the meta-analysis: (1) any training with BFR (BFR-T) vs control group (CG); (2) resistance training associated with BFR (BFR-RT) vs resistance training without BFR (RT) and (3) BFR-RT vs high-load resistance training without BFR (HL). Standardized mean differences and their respective confidence intervals were reported for the meta-analysis. The study quality was assessed with the PEDro scale. Results: Eight studies with 201 participants were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. According to PEDro scale studies had a regular quality. BFR-T had a small non-significant effect size on increasing muscle strength in older adults compared to CG (0.11 [-0.05, 0.28]) regardless of the type of training (resistance training or aerobic training). Likewise, regardless of the type of training, BFR-T had a small non-significant effect size on increasing muscle mass in older adults compared to CG (0.20 [-0.05, 0.46]). There were no significant differences between RT and BFR-RT over strength gains in older adults (0.01 [-0,28, 0,25]). HL had a small non-significant effect size on increasing muscle strength in older adults compared to BFR-RT (0.17 [-0.18, 0.51]). Regarding physical function, BFR-T had a large effect over the time to complete Up and Go test (1.32 [0.49, 2.14] and Sit to Stand test (0.78 [0.10, 1.46]) compared to GC. Conclusions: BFR training is not an advantage on increasing strength and muscle mass in older adults compared to training without BFR. There are no changes in results depending on the type of training associated with BFR. However, BFR training is an advantage over the time to complete Up and Go test and Sit to Stand test. Future studies with higher methodological quality are necessary to determine how BFR training adaptations are related to changes in the physical function of older adults.

AB	To survey researchers' efforts in depth in learning new problems, issues, motives on research related to children's profiles; sculpting the literature into a clear and structed taxonomy; and determining the basic attributes of this research in terms of motivation and challenges, as well as recommendations and future studies. A focused search for each article was conducted on child profiles in four major databases: ScienceDirect, Web of Science, EBSCO, and ERIC. These databases are broad and sufficient to cover child profile studies in the literature. The initial query search resulted in 99 articles: (15/99) from ScienceDirect database, (45/99) from WoS, (23/99) from ERIC, and (16/99) articles from EBSCO, from 2011 to 2016. Those papers were thoroughly perused for the main purpose of developing a general map for research conducted on this emerging topic. Most of the articles (81.82%; 81/99) were measurement and evaluation papers; (15.15%; 15/99) were review and survey papers that refer to the literature in order to describe the child profile; and (3.03%; 3/99) were a design. Since 2011, researchers have followed the trend of child profile applications in many ways, while leaving certain aspects for further attention. Regardless of their categorization, articles focus on several challenges that hinder the full utility of child profile apps and do recommend mitigations. Research on child profiles is active and highly varied. In this paper, we hope that this review of previous studies will contribute to understanding the challenges and gaps that are available to other researchers to join this research line.

AB	Cloud data storage (Storage as a Service) is an important service of cloud computing referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The cloud storage provides data storage facilities as well as sharing across multiple users. Day by day it is gaining popularity because of enormous benefits. But emerging data security and privacy issues have become a subject of primo to the users as well as the service providers. That's why we proposed a technique for enhancing the security of cloud data using cryptography, steganography, and hash function. For cryptography, we use Blowfish algorithm and for steganography, a new efficient embedded algorithm using Embedded Least Significant Bits (E-LSB), and for integrity checking, we use SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm. This system is implemented in Eclipse using Java. We first encrypt the data and then hide it in an image to fulfill our purpose. As Blowfish [1] is an existing encryption algorithm which is secure enough, so, we just check out the steganography method's security. After hiding the data in a cover image, data detection and data destruction attacks are applied to evaluate the security of this steganography system. Detection attacks, such as visual attack, RS attack can't detect any data. In case of destruction attacks, such as jpeg compression, format conversion, salt& pepper, rotation, we got average NC value. So this steganography method is quite sensitive to destruction attack but it is secure in data detection attacks, which is the main purpose of steganography. During quality measurement, we are getting better PSNR value such as after hiding 1KB data in a cover image of size 512x512 pixels, we get PSNR value on average around 63 dB which is better than the previously existing methods.

AB	Introduction: It is widely acknowledged that the etiology of hypertension was multifactorial. Beginning from genetic factor to the external factors has been found to be the cause of hypertension. Unhealthy lifestyle was the most external factor that linked to hypertension. Within this factor, dietary habit of coffee consumption was believed to increase the risk of having hypertension. This was because caffeine contributes to increase blood pressure. However this effect was poorly understood in hypertensive persons. This evidence based case report has the objective to investigate does coffee consumption could increase blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Methods: The literature searching was done through several online databases, such as PubMed, Proquest, Cochrane Library, Ebsco, and Wiley Online Library. One article was selected after screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria, reading title and abstract, filtering double, and reading the full text. The article was then critically appraised for validity, importance, and applicability. Result: Based on critical appraisal of the selected article (A. E. Mesas et al.), it is confirmed that coffee or caffeine intake elevates both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in various amounts according to the ingested doses. Conclusion: In conclusion, coffee or caffeine consumption increased blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

AB	The ability of a graduate to communicate in oral and written forms in a foreign language for solving the problems of interpersonal and intercultural interaction is one of the basic general cultural competencies formed in the process of tertiary education. As a rule, students have a high motivation for studying special subjects directly connected to their profession. A foreign language serves as a sort of auxiliary discipline, allowing one to optimise the process of communication among representatives of various cultures, therefore the indicator of motivation for learning another language and the indicator showing acquisition of this competency have a significant dispersion. In the process of teaching, instructors encounter a number of problems connected with the need for a differentiated approach for teaching. At the same time, assessment criteria for foreign language learning have to be similar for students with different initial levels of command of another language.Within a sociological study, authors made an attempt to single out a dependency of the initial level of command of the English language among students from their place of residence and school education, dependency of their academic record from the degree of their interest to learning the foreign language both at school and at university, defining self-assessment of students with various majors of their command of specific skills in different types of academic activities in English.Authors have made a conclusion that it is necessary to introduce a flexible differentiated approach to teaching English at a university, as it would allow not only to account for the initial level of command of a foreign language, but also to provide for correction and balance of development among specific competencies. Simultaneously the article underlines the intricacy of the given complex approach, as it requires a larger amount of physical and technical resources as well as timing budgets. Authors emphasise the necessity to coordinate teaching of the English language at both school and university levels with the international system of certifying command of the English language.

World Health Organization (WHO) stated that uncontrolled blood pressure raised from 600 million people in 1980 to 1 billion people in 2008. Objectives: To know the effectiveness of the behavioral and educational intervention in improving blood pressure control in hypertensive adult patients compared to educational intervention alone in routine visits. Methods: Literature search was conducted in online databases such as Medline (PubMed), EBSCO, and Cochrane. Three studies were critically appraised. Results: First study had the number needed to treat (NNT) of 25 (95% Cl 23,9-26.01) and 50 (95% Cl 48.9-51.0), The second study had NNT of 20 (95% Cl 19.89-20.11). The NNT of the third study was unknown. Conclusions: The behavioral and educational intervention was more effective in improving blood pressure control in hypertensive adult patients than educational intervention alone in routine visits.

AB	Background: During pregnancy, the hormonal changes cause hypotonic and hypoperistaltic condition through the cholinergic and serotonin pathways. Ginger is also known as rhizome of ginger (zingiber offcinale) can be used as alternative nonpharmacological therapy to increase gastric and peristaltic muscle tone through anti-serotonergic and anticholinergic pathways. Method: Literature searching was conducted using online database Pubmed, Cochrane, Springer, EBSCO, and ProQUEST. Article searching was conducted according to keywords, criteria of inclusion, and exclusion that have been determined. Furthermore, it is critically reviewed using the instruments already available. Objective: The type of study is evidence based medicine. This study aimed to find out evidence that ginger can be used as alternative nonpharmacological therapy to reduce nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Results: Ginger is more effective and safe to reduce symptoms of nausea vomiting during pregnancy. But the results still have high heterogeneity due to variations in the study. Conclusion: Ginger can be used as an alternative non-pharmacological therapy that helps reduce symptoms of NVP (nausea and vomiting in pregnancy). However, further research is needed to obtain clear evidence of the effects of ginger therapy in reducing the symptoms of NVP.

AB	Background: The unexpected surge of casualties from a disaster or major incident poses a challenge to medical institutions. Disasters including extreme weather, natural disasters, bioterrorism, and pandemics are having an increased on global impact. Hospitals play an essential role during disasters, as they provide "lifeline" services in reducing disaster associated mortality and hence minimize the impact of disasters on community. Method: Systematic review of the Protocol is based on PRISMA. Literature searching using database of online journal (Proquest and EBSCO). Filtered search by keyword hospital preparedness, disaster, and impact. Literature were then filtered by articles in English, by year, by Fix and Journal Article and based on studies conducted in hospitals. Exclusion criteria were the libraries with insufficient information to be compared with other journals. Result: 9 of 12 of the studies resulted in standard operational procedures and conduct continuity of service during disaster, 6 of 12 regularly conduct training and staff education to improve capability, 5 of 12 prepare infrastructure for evacuation of victims, 4 of 12 add and store stock of drugs for disaster condition, 3 of 12 cooperate with various parties to recover victims more quickly. Conclusion: The results suggest the level of hospital preparedness, as measured by function. Recommendations for the future are: improvement of standard operational in regional and national procedures, continuation of training, research and development for staff, adding infrastructure for evacuation of victims, adequate drug storage and strengthen cooperation with other parties to save the victims.

AB	Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and a global health problem. In vitro studies have shown that the active metabolite of vitamin D which is 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) could increase anti-mycobacterial activity of mononuclear phagocytes that control the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is expected that vitamin D supplementation could increase sputum conversion which is one of the indicators of TB treatment. Objective: To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on sputum conversion in adults with TB. Methods: A search was conducted ProQuest, Cochrane, EBSCO, and PubMed. Three relevant articles were obtained, and an assessment of the validity, importance, and applicability of those studies was conducted. Results: Both RCTs (A. P. Ralph, et al., Plos One 8, 1 (2013) and P. Daley, et al., Lancet. Infect. Dis. 15, 528 (2015)) showed a higher rate of sputum conversion in the control group, although not statistically significant. A meta analysis of RCTs by X. Jingyan, et al., Chin. Med. J. 127, 3127 (2014) showed that vitamin D supplementation could increase sputum conversion but the increase is also not statistically significant. Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation does not increase sputum conversion in adults with TB.

AB	Introduction: As the technology advancement, we tend to work more using computer or another video display terminals (VDT). VDT usage often causes eyes problems (computer vision syndrome) or even refractive errors. This study aims to evaluate computer or VDT exposure as prognostic factor in myopia regression among young adults. Methods: Literature review method using medical journal is conducted through three databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Ebsco). Keywords used are myopia, myopia progression, computer, and job (including their synonyms). Results: Thirty-two articles were collected. Through title and abstract screening, filtering doubles, and exclusion, only three articles that can be critically appraised. Based on these articles, myopia progression proportion among the population is around 10,5% with myopia progression risk around -0,16 D annually. Myopia progression predictor factor is near work (along with computer and VDT usage). Conclusion: Myopia progression is related with near work notably computer usage. Thus, near work exposure should be decreased to prevent myopia progression.

AB	Introduction: Diabetic nephropathy, a Diabetes Mellitus' complication, leads to chronic renal failure. Previous studies found that proximal tubule of nephron, as the initial pathogenesis of DN, precedes state of albuminuria as the current biomarker of DN. This study aimed to propose the earliest and the most accurate tubular biomarkers in predicting onset of DN and assess progression of DN. Methods: Systematic review was performed to evaluate the validity and accuracy of tubular biomarkers based on available studies in EBSCO, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Validity was measured by scoring system including studies' methodological quality assessment based on Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy and adjustment score to DN conventional factors. Accuracy evaluation was reviewed based on accuracy value provided. From the total of 560 studies, 10 included studies were assessed and 5 biomarkers were compared. Results: All studies were considered valid, except one study on NGAL marker. Based on their likelihood ratios for clinical application, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) has the best accuracy in predicting onset of DN and Cystatin C in assessing progression of DN. Detection of these biomarkers could be applied clinically through quantitative and semi-quantitative method for potential use in all healthcare levels and locations. Conclusion: This review proposed the usage of NAG and Cystatin C as early and accurate diabetic nephropathy tubular biomarkers in all healthcare level.

AB	The Stockholm syndrome is a term used to describe a paradoxical psychological experience in which an affective bond between hostages and their captors is developed. However, currently there is no unification of criteria with respect to its diagnosis and characteristics and even its denomination of "syndrome". The objective of the present study was to review and summarize the existing international literature of the Stockholm syndrome. Databases (PUBMED, Google Scholar, Academic Onefile, and EBSCO) were systematically searched. After analyzing the 23 articles selected, it could be considered that the expansion of the term to different cases or groups is an important indicator that it is a universal instinctive response of survival, although the lack of empirical studies could lead to the conclusion that many of the characteristics of the term are due to an information bias.

AB	The techniques of visual merchandising are used in fashion retail in order to gain competitive advantage against an increasingly dynamic and challenging scenario. In addition, current consumers do not only seek the ideal product, but mainly the experience derived from this search and acquisition process. The present study investigates the scientific production related to the use of visual merchandising techniques in fashion retail associated with consumer experience. To do this, a bibliometric research was carried out in national and international journals using the Ebsco, Scopus, Spell, Web of Science and Scielo databases covering the last seven years (2010-2016). After the data collection, the content analysis was performed, being this a mixed approach research (qualitative and quantitative). Among the results, it was possible to identify, in addition to the most researched visual merchandising variables, possible theoretical gaps still to be developed, such as those related to online retail, a growing area, but still incipient in terms of academic research, and those that associate visual merchandising variables with the buying experience as a whole, once these variables are normally being studied in isolation.

AB	Globalization and the advent of Information and communication technologies have influenced substantial changes in forms of management. The intense global competitive scenario have generated new forms of competition for the various players. Faced with the unstable and complex environment, organizations need to focus their efforts on shared strategies. Agribusiness presents a set of specificities that lead to greater complexity to manage the activities. Regarding the agro industrial fruit pulp chain, this dynamic becomes even more complex, considering the peculiarities of the sector. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the fruit pulp chain from the perspective of the business processes of Supply Chain ManagementTo do so, eight business processes were considered for the qualitative analysis supported by the bibliographical research on a well-known scientific basis such as Web of Science, Scopus and EBSCO. Considering the study of a current phenomenon and according to the profile of the research agents, it is a multiple case study applied in four fruit pulp processing agro industries. The results describe the business processes and the activities that compose it in the fruit pulp sector, allowing understanding the synchronous and dependent relationship between the processes, as well as the importance of information sharing in the dynamics among all activities.

AB	Background: A father's ability to cope with fatherhood in the perinatal period has received limited attention in the literature. Recent studies have shown that both mothers and fathers are challenged by the demands of parenthood.Aims: The challenges experienced by fathers during the perinatal period are explored and specific risk factors are identified. The aim of this paper was to develop a framework embedding the identified risk factors into a theoretical model that could be applied in predicting paternal emotional well-being.Methods: This literature review consulted English peer-reviewed papers as far back as 1990. Databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, EBSCO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were examined.Results: The results of the literature review depicted a number of factors that could be aggregated into four clusters, including vulnerability factors, precipitating factors, coping style, and socio-cultural factors.Limitation: The literature review was limited as it only examined English based peer-reviewed articles.Conclusion: The suggested model is based on various theoretical concepts and empirical findings. The application of this model could assist clinicians in the identification of at-risk perinatal fathers and target interventions to specific challenges experienced by perinatal fathers.

AB	The current study examined the influence of students' openness to multiculturalism on the frequency of integrating Online Collaborative Learning (OCL). The mediating variables were attitudes toward: benefits of OCL, negative aspects of OCL and challenges of OCL. The participants were 315 ICT coordinators who are also subject teachers. 139 coordinators had participated in at least one OCL training program (44%) and 176 coordinators had not (56%). The questionnaire was based on previous ones and comprised 33 items. Path analysis findings indicate that the negative aspects of OCL were a very significant mediating factor in the model, affecting the paths between openness to multiculturalism and experiencing the challenges of OCL, and the frequency of the integration of OCL. Furthermore, for ICT coordinators who had taken part in the OCL programs and saw openness toward multiculturalism among their students, there was little impact when there were complex challenges in the OCL. It may be that educating toward multiculturalism leads to an atmosphere of openness and egalitarianism, to better interpersonal relations and social skills in the class, and so they summon fewer frustrating situations in OCL. This is an atmosphere that assures collaboration and attainment of positive learning results.

AB	Different studies on democracy and political disaffection are of the belief that the internet and social networks provide new opportunities for social mobilization and citizen participation. The social mobilizations of the second decade of the 21st century, such as the Arab Spring or the 15M in Spain, defined the protagonist role of online communication and social networks for the summon and the development of protests. This paper, which uses the stages of moral development and applies them to social reality, provides a theoretical proposal for a three-dimensional analysis (introducing the concepts of strategy, action, and objective) to study contemporary social mobilizations. It also presents and compares the three analytical dimensions and uses them to characterize, in an exploratory manner, three cases of social mobilization (the Arab Spring in Egypt, the 15M, and the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages in Spain). In the text, the use of social networks and the media is a transverse study based on the three dimensions proposed. The analysis shows that some forms of protest have declined to the feelings of political frustration of citizens, and they have been displaced to a second institutional level or suffered a systematic disarticulation. We propose the conceptualization of the contemporary social movement as a collective space built on a strategy aimed at a specific political system that performs change actions focused on autonomy processes and sets out long-term objectives that have been agreed upon.

AB	The age of the culprit can be a factor affecting the judge mind to sentence him/her with milder punishment. In other words, regarding the age of the culprit and the judge's legal range of freedom for determining mild and sever criminal penalties, the judge may sentence him/her with mild punishment. In this research, the possible effect of this variable on the determination of punishment in the criminal justice system of Iran and its introduction as one scale for determination of penalty, classified into young and old age, are assessed. The results show that the old age of culprit does not affect the determination and discount of punishment but the judges would like to protect young-old culprits from the consequences of criminal penalties. Although this case is accepTable and defendable but this discount is not involving old-age culprits and it is not psychologically reasonable because the goal of punishment is not implemented for these culprits.

AB	This study reports on the examination of search transaction logs from web-scale discovery tools at two Indiana University campuses. The authors discuss how they gathered search queries from transaction logs, categorized queries according to the Library of Congress Classification schedule, and then examined queries using text analysis tools in order to identify which subjects were being searched and whether users were using advanced search options. The results of this investigation demonstrate how transaction logs may be used to communicate user interactions within discovery services. The findings offer detailed insight into the subjects and skills that teaching faculty and librarians should communicate to improve information literacy instruction. The search queries also uncover information needs that provide direction for collection managers.

AB	With the use of machine learning and other advances, modern information search systems make it easy for searchers to access information to meet their most frequent information needs. Building from Kuhlthau's concepts of exploration and differentiating, this article argues that along with the benefits of greater accessibility, these advances impede the development of information literacy, conceptualized as processes for planning, accessing, judging and communicating information. It is argued that information literacy emerges during interaction with search systems and modern system designs hide or render unworkable the contextual information needed for the judgment processes of information literacy. In response to these concerns, the article contributes desiderata for new designs that facilitate the discovery, navigation and use of context information.

AB	Electronic information resources are increasingly become an important component of the collection-building activities of libraries. This paper attempts to understand how far the licenses of commercial publishers support resource optimisation in general and what other important issues that are usually ignored by publishers, knowingly or unknowingly, but are essential for better resource optimisation. Five international publishers namely Elsevier, EBSCO, Sage, Springer, and Taylor & Francis were identified and analysed their agreements that are available in public domain with some model agreements like Liblicense model and model license developed by John Cox Associate. Study indicates that core part of the negotiations still remain price, IP access, display, ILL/document supply, etc. while important issues like perpetual access, archiving, self-archiving, copy of individual articles and share the same for non-commercial use by authorised users were minor issues of the contract. Furthermore, most of the obligations of the publishers that are identified as core issues in Liblicense model are also absent in commercial publishers' license. A greater awareness of this to library managers is essential. They must be acquainted with the clause of the license agreement of commercial publishers and must negotiate to that extent so that the access should be uninterrupted.

AB	Spanish public libraries are faced with the scarce implementation of digital loans among their readers. The offer of this service, fragmented in several platforms, and its lack of integration with other resources such as the online catalog implies a greater effort of adaptation for users and places the libraries themselves at a disadvantage. Through a system of indicators, the 3 main Spanish e-book loan platforms [OdiloTK (from Odilo), Xebook (from Xercode), and iBiblio (from Libranda)] are evaluated through their implementation in eBiblio Galicia, Galician Catalog of GaliciaLe (CGG) and eBookVigo / eBook DiCoruna, respectively. There is evidence of the differences between them and a need to provide a unique and integrated access to the functions provided by discovery tools and APIs.

AB	The success or failure of any tool, service or system used in a library is predicated on the audience it finds. While web-scale discovery systems have developed widespread adoption in academic libraries, there is a sense from librarians that they continue to be in search of their true audience. Librarians play a key role in the utilization of web-scale discovery systems, and their experiences as an end user of these systems may influence their attitudes in many ways. The survey discussed in this article looks at the attitudes librarians have toward web-scale discovery systems when using them for their personal research, including feature preferences and inquiries into opinions regarding strengths and weaknesses of the system. The results of this survey provide some insights into why some librarians struggle with the idea using of web-scale discovery systems by themselves and by the patrons with which they work.

AB	To review recent literature on the rate and barrier to return to work (RTW) as well as the type of occupation reentry after spinal cord injury (SCI). Study search had been conducted in health sciences databases such as MEDLINE via OvidSP, Cinahl via Ebsco and PubMed from 2010-2015. The keywords used were 'spinal cord injuries,' 'spinal cord injury,' 'spinal cord lesion' 'tetraplegia,' 'paraplegia,' or 'quadriplegia,' 'employment,' 'return to work,' 'occupation' or 'vocational.' The search had retrieved 623 references to be filtered. The filtration yielded 346 abstracts to be assessed for eligibility. The abstracts reviewed yielded 21 eligible studies for further review. The rate of RTW was found low in most of the included studies with the range of 12.9% to 42.1%. Paraplegia, male, adult, and higher physical function had been the most employed. Low physical demand job such as management and administration, lecturing, teaching, and training, business and services, were the most re-entered. Secondary complications, transportation, poor accessibility at work, lack of knowledge and job were the most common barriers to RTW. Better health status, higher physical function, support and consideration, emotional stability and motivation, higher education, and transportation may facilitate the RTW. This information may assist the case or disability management, particularly during job seeking period to enhance the rate of RTW among SCI.

PY	2018
AB	This paper describes two projects that promote interlibrary loan (ILL) in both traditional online public access catalogs and discovery settings to address user frustrations with gaps in the collection. By creating and inserting OpenURL links into bibliographic records for titles held exclusively by external institutions, the authors leveraged the discovery capabilities of their shared catalog and promoted ILL as an alternative means of access. The second project targeted the overwhelming amount of content indexed in the library's discovery layer that was not locally available. To more directly translate discovery into access, the authors worked with EBSCO to create and enable ILL CustomLinks for this content indexed by EBSCO Discovery Service and not available to their users. This paper presents ILL data to investigate whether these projects are changing the ways our users find and access content not held locally.

AB	Background: The frequent and intensive training and performance of pre-professional ballet dancers and sportspersons is offered at a time when young ballet dancers and young athletes may be vulnerable to injury due to the progress through adolescence and growth spurts.Hypothesis: There are changes in range of motion during the progress through adolescence and growth periods in dancers and sportspersons. These changes in ROM can be linked to the increase of injury.Objectives: The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine whether there are changes in ROM during the progress through adolescence and growth spurts in dancers and sportspersons. The secondary aim is to determine whether these changes can predict the risk of injuries for adolescent dancers and sportspersons.Search strategy: Pubmed, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trails (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), EBSCO Host databases: CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Embase were searched using MeSH terms. Manual search in the Journal of Dance Medicine and Science and screening of the reference lists of identified studies and reviews was conducted.Selection criteria: Studies included adolescent dancers and sportspersons, aged 8-18, both sexes, growth spurt related to changes in ROM and injury incidence.Data collection and analysis: Search strategy was performed in the flow diagram of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Two reviewers independently appraised each included study using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) for methodological quality of the included studies. For data extraction, the following information was systematically extracted: first author and year of publication, study design, participants (sample size of mean age), age, maturation (if assessed), intervention, outcome(s), and some notes of each study. For evaluation of the risk of bias and precision the Research Triangle Institute Item Bank (RTI-IB) is included.Main results: Seven observational studies met the inclusion criteria of this current review. The results of this review suggest that there are changes in ROM during the progress through adolescence and growth spurts in dancers and sportspersons. These changes may lead to an increase in injury incidence.Conclusion: There is evidence linking to changes in ROM during the progress through adolescence and growth spurts in dancers and sportspersons. These changes in ROM may be related to injury incidence.

AB	The purpose of this study was to conduct a review of research on the Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility model-based programme within physical education. Papers selected for analysis were found through searches of Web of Science, SportDiscus (EBSCO), SCOPUS, and ERIC (ProQuest) databases. The keywords responsibility model' and physical education' were used in different combinations. The relevant articles were checked for the following criteria: (a) the study has been published in a peer-reviewed international journal; (b) it included Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility model-based programme implementation; (c) programmes were implemented within physical education classes; and (d) the full text was available in English or Spanish. The quality of the selected studies was scored using a quality assessment list. Twenty-two papers that satisfied the selection criteria were identified. A practical analysis of these papers to present the results placed them into three categories: (a) impact of the Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility model-based programme on teachers; (b) programme implementation features; and (c) outcomes of the Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility-based programme on student participants. Longer studies with follow-up data, quantitative methodological designs, and larger samples would be particularly important for future investigations.

AB	The deployment of the Lean Thinking principles determines structure and processes in organizations which seek to achieve better levels of productivity and efficiency by eliminating waste and continuous improvement initiatives. The processes of information management and organizational knowledge management are relevant in this scenario, since the recognition of the strategic importance of information and the dissemination of knowledge among the different functions of the organization are critical factors for the achievement of a superior performance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify that Lean Thinking practices are facilitating factors for a creation and dissemination of organizational knowledge. It is a research based on a literature review of the scientific production developed from 2007 to 2016 on studies that investigated aspects of organizational knowledge management in contexts of Lean Thinking deployment available in the Scopus, Lista-Ebsco, Emerald, Web of Science and Science Direct databases. The method chosen was PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews). The literature review evidenced the existence of Lean Thinking practices that facilitate the creation and dissemination of organizational knowledge, such as: organizational structure, autonomy, integration mechanisms, knowledge replication, contextual ambidexterity, learning and use of lean tools. The characteristics identified in these practices make possible all phases of the knowledge conversion process (SECI process) and promote networks of interactions in which knowledge is created, shared and used by people in organizational environments. It is also concluded that the deployment of the Lean Thinking principles allows gains in efficiency and productivity that are obtained by the elimination of wastes in the work processes and that promotes the development of a suitable context for the management of organizational knowledge.

AB	Working dogs can perform many tasks that improve the lives of humans. An explosion of new technologies in Animal-Computer Interaction enable dogs to assist in a variety of scenarios. Dogs can summon emergency services, report finding a lost child, determine what explosive they just detected, alert to a tornado siren, and much more. Giving working dogs the ability to clearly communicate could be life-saving. Related technologies can measure aspects of a dog's behavior to assess temperament, predict training success, and even monitor health. The Georgia Tech Animal-Computer Interaction lab has been researching dog-centered interfaces since 2012. Our studies have included instrumented vests, touchscreens, and devices that provide new ways for dogs to communicate what they perceive to people around them. We have also researched instrumented dog toys for temperament analysis and health monitoring. For the ACI2018 demonstrations, we showcase the technologies we have developed for dogs and the new interactions these technologies enable.

AB	Food security and global sustainability are important challenges for the current planet evolution, being the communities and ecosystems separated from the big cities, the most vulnerable. On the other hand, and in accordance with what is stated by the sustainable development objectives, there is a hypothesis about the supply of energy that can bring benefits and challenges for the communities, and for which the intervention of actors of the academy, the state, is required, the company, the civil society in search of a sustainable development. In the search for energization solutions for communities, it is necessary to carry out engineering designs that consider various socioeconomic variables, in which the incorporation of Information and Communication Technologies can favor the structuring and organization of data related to these different variables.The research described in this article aims to conduct a review of descriptive literature on ICT solutions for the analysis of energy supply in smart cities, including the description of a test case in a community belonging to an agropolis. For its development, a review of the descriptive literature was carried out, consulting databases such as Scielo, Ebsco and IEEE and ScienceDirect; The search strategy was based on the combination of the keywords ICT, Software and Energy.Finally, different software tools were identified for the analysis of the energy supply, identifying that the Homer Energy tool was the most appropriate integral to perform the modeling. All of the above integrated to describe a possible mode of application for a representative case in an agropolis whose source of development is goat livestock.(1)

AB	In January 2016, the University of Toledo Libraries implemented EBSCO Discovery Services (EDS) as its discovery layer. Administrators questioned whether users were able to find consortial material in the EDS, so they assembled a task force to conduct a pilot usability test. The task force gathered demographic data and recorded the screens of 25 students answering six task questions. Results showed participants could easily find most items except books, and for tasks that were open-ended, many students continued searching even though they found relevant material. To determine why participants could not find books, the task force consulted with EBSCO and discovered a configuration problem that was easily resolved by editing a mapping table and adding a custom limiter for print books. The searching issue was more difficult to determine, and the task force suggests a lack of library instruction may be at least partly to blame. Libraries invest significant resources in discovery layers. If users have difficulty using them or finding relevant material for their assignments, libraries need to address that issue and instruction is one solution. This pilot study reports on what the University Libraries did to make the EDS more usable for its users.

AB	The present study is a bibliometric analysis of publications on interventions based on third generation therapies in children and adolescents during the years 2011-2016. For this, a descriptive study was carried out in which 60 scientific articles from diverse databases were analyzed, such as Proquest, Redalyc, Sage, ScienceDirect and Springer Science, Dialnet, Ebsco Host. It was evidenced that between the years 2012 and 2014 there was an increase in the publications of third generation therapies in Ibero-America and Europe. The International Journal of Behavioral Consultation & Therapy presents the largest number of publications in this field. In relation to the author who presents the most publications, reference is made to Swart, J as the principal. The theoretical review and the quasi-experimental study were the most reported methodology and Mindfulness the most used therapy. As for the country with the largest number of investigations in this area is the United States. This study allows us to conclude that third generation therapies have begun to gain strength in several behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents. However, it is necessary to expand the research in this field since in most articles the degree of efficacy is not quantified.

AB	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the reports from research on the relationship between divergent thinking and gender, as well as to present the results of own studies verifying the correlation between creativity and gender. Creativity is a highly desired personal competence on the modern labor market, especially due to its key role in the processes of creating innovative solutions. Simultaneously, it is believed that creativity as a trait constitutes basic economic capital.Methodology: The analysis of current reports from scientific research has been conducted on the basis of articles available in Ebsco and Google Scholar databases. The study has been based on the Test for Creative Thinking Drawing Production - TCT-DP. 80 trainers of soft training participated in the study. The research was guided by the theory of creativity and divergent thinking.Findings: The own research has demonstrated that gender does not determine the level of creativity. However, reports from studies using neuroimaging techniques point to visible differences between levels of creativity in women and men.Practical implications: This article demonstrates that the issue of the relationship between divergent thinking and gender is a complex phenomenon and sensitive to many co-occurring variables. Depending on the research methods used, the results of exploration differ from each other. The results of the survey show that the management should carefully approach gender differences in level of creativity. Gender should not be an argument for the employment of a person for a creative role.Value: The article suggests that the problem of gender differences in terms of creativity is a multi-faceted problem. Gender should not, therefore, determine the scope or nature of tasks entrusted to employees by their supervisors or team leaders.

AB	This paper summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the issue of ambidexterity in leadership. The main purpose of the research is to provide a theoretical guidance on those antecedents and perspectives of Ambidextrous Leadership (AL) which is based on a literature review. Literary sources and approaches dealing with these paradoxical behaviours indicate that besides a contextual organizational framework especially managers are mainly in the focus of research. The relevance of the decision of this scientific problem is that many organizations today need to be flexible and adaptable simultaneously for fulfilling their goals. Investigation of the topic AL in the paper is carried out in the following logical sequence. After introducing the relevance and need of new approaches in leadership, the fundamental theory and consequences on AL are provided. Therefore, the theoretical basis for ambidexterity is explained and reasons to understand ambidexterity as a leadership challenge are given. Methodological tools of the research methods were undertaken through a review of 25 papers that have been published in peer-reviewed journals since 2004 and up to 2017. For this, a more detailed understanding and discussion are also provided, which has been based on the analysis of the most-cited articles. The analysis has been based on English and German language articles that appear in EBSCO and Beluga. The paper presents the results of a first attempt to provide a literature review which covered the concept of ambidexterity and its relevance as a scientific contribution. The theoretical concept provided the main determinants and consequences for the need for flexible, adaptable, and sustainable leadership. It becomes clear that the antecedents of ambidexterity can be used to understand the positive effects on this need and that this management approach has prospects for sustainability. The research literarily confirms and theoretically proves that ultimately; besides implementation and conceptual problems many management issues can take with this approach. The results of the research can be useful for leading researchers and practitioners. The selected papers may be also used as a valid starting point to research AL with respect to antecedents and perspectives. Managers can also benefit from a better understanding of this concept.

AB	The city of Barcelona has become a prime tourist destination thanks to good planning initiated following the Olympic Games in 1992. The Barcelona brand has been consolidating through characteristics such as an important cultural heritage, a situation favorable climatic and significant in the field of fairs and congresses, differentiating it from the rest of the competition both domestic and international investment. One of the points that has been boosted lately has been the cultural tourism, but this is based on the extensive cultural heritage of Barcelona and not in the museum infrastructures. The aim of this study is to provide information on the economic contribution posed by museums to total tourism revenue. From the information provided by the Government of Catalonia, the museums themselves, as well as other studies of matter.

AB	The purpose of this document is initially related to the identification of academic publications on sustainability reports, in particular those that link the referents of the Global Reporting Initiative [GRI] and which are intended to study business contexts in Latin America, for later Characterize the publications found. For this purpose, 18 articles published between 2006 and 2016 were collected in the databases of EBSCO, JSTOR and ScienceDirect. The research developed is quantitative and qualitative with a descriptive approach, firstly, quantitative because it makes use of bibliometric techniques that allow to determine where the literature focuses in this field and, qualitatively because it is based on a review of content analysis. The results indicate that most of the studies have focused on evaluating the use of sustainability reports as a management reporting tool, mainly considering the number of indicators, the model chosen or adapted and the periodicity and depth of the information.

AB	Using translation in ESP teaching and learning is an important issue but it has been very scarcely researched so far because of the negative connotations with the grammar-translation method. But since the last decade of the 20th century, revival of interest in the use of translation and use of L1 in foreign language teaching has been noticeable. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to analyse academic publications on the use of translation (and L1) in the ESP teaching and learning in order to see what aspects are raised by researchers and practitioners as regards the efficiency of translation as a teaching method in ESP classes in higher education. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to see what important and telling themes are evident in the selected academic publications, and (2) to analyse the attitudes of the authors of the papers towards using translation as a supplementary teaching method in teaching/learning ESP. For this paper, inductive thematic analysis has been chosen as a useful qualitative analytic method (Brown and Clarke 2006). The data corpus for this paper (14 quality papers) has been collected by conducting a systematic literature search of two academic online databases: EBSCO Academic Search Complete and Web of Science. Initially, emerging themes have been grouped under two headings - learner needs and teaching practices - and elaborated further on as specific themes: defining learner profile, course design, translation as a communicative activity, focusing on accuracy, facilitating understanding, defining specific tasks, consolidating particular skills, balancing the amount of translation in the ESP classroom. The inductive thematic analysis of the academic publications done for this paper shows that translation-based activities are useful for the ESP learner and that translation is an efficient ESP teaching and learning method if the amount of translation done is well-balanced, activities are well-planned and the learner profile and needs in each specific course well-analysed. Translation activities consolidate reading, writing, speaking and listening skills of the ESP learners, facilitate communication and comprehension of a specific field, develop analytic skills and teach to focus on accuracy.

AB	Purpose - Last spring, EBSCO Information Services conducted a usability study with several students with visual impairments. The goal was to understand how these students conduct research and identify areas for improvement of EBSCO Discovery Service (TM) such that it would meet the needs of all potential users. EBSCO Discovery Service (TM) provides users with means of accessing all of an institution's internal (library) and external (database vendors) information resources through a single search. The purpose of this paper is to outline the findings of this research and the applicability to the design of any online resource.Design/methodology/approach - Using the Bentley University's user experience lab to facilitate the study and the Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton, Massachusetts, for recruitment of college students, EBSCO solicited feedback on how students conduct research on the Web in general, as well as their experience using EBSCO's discovery service. The study involved a structured interview with eight visually impaired students from the Boston area, who had recently been enrolled in a college course. The students were also asked to complete certain tasks using the discovery service and report out as they completed each activity.Findings - The findings demonstrated that for the most part, students with visual impairments engaged in research on the Web and within the discovery service in a similar manner to sighted students. They used the same standard search sites, expected the same layout conventions for results' lists and filters and wanted easily savable full-text documents. Main differences involved their ability to navigate in a similar way to sighted users. Elements that one could skip over quickly as a sighted user were more of a hindrance to those relying on a screen reader. Additionally, improved descriptions for graphics, functions and form fields were noted as opportunities for improvement. For those with low vision, using screen magnifiers, modal boxes and hover features or other unexpected changes on the site proved to be challenging.Research limitations/implications - This study focused only on students with visual disabilities. There are many other print disabilities that were not explored such as color blindness, cognitive disabilities or learning disabilities. All the students were in their 20s and had experience conducting research and using library or research-related search sites. Many of the findings highlighted areas of improvement that would benefit all students.Originality/value - A study on students with visual disabilities using assistive technologies as they completed research tasks on a discovery system has not been studied before. Guidelines and audits do not provide a complete picture as to whether a website is fully accessible. It is only by working with actual users that insight into what it means to create a truly accessible experience can be gained.

AB	Objective - This article describes how librarians systematically compared different e-book platforms to identify which features and design impact usability and user satisfaction.Methods - This study employed task-based usability testing, including the "think-aloud protocol." Students at the University of Colorado Boulder completed a series of typical tasks to compare the usability and measure user satisfaction with academic e-books. For each title, five students completed the tasks on three e-book platforms: the publisher platform and two aggregators. Thirty-five students evaluated seven titles on nine academic e-book platforms.Results - This study identified each platform's strengths and weaknesses based on students' experiences and preferences. The usability tests indicated that students preferred Ebook Central over EBSCO and strongly preferred the aggregators over publisher platforms.Conclusions - Librarians can use student expectations and preferences to guide e-book purchasing decisions. Preferences may vary by institution, but variations in e-book layout and functionality impact students' ability to successfully complete tasks and influences their affinity for or satisfaction with any given platform. Usability testing is a useful tool for gauging user expectations and identifying preferences for features, functionality, and layout.

Introduces its new publisher Grey House Publishing, Amenia, N.Y., which recently acquired comprehensive rights for the Sears along with its aboriginal publisher, the H W Wilson from the Ebsco Information Services. The system is available both in print and online versions. Names a few new subject headings in areas like science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM). In this edition, there are a total of 1,600 new headings making it a total of 12,000+ preferred headings meant for subject access in small and medium sized libraries. This unprecedented increase of about 1,600 headings is mostly due the complete incorporation of the Canadian Sears last published independently in 2006. Also critically examines inconsistencies in a few headings. Concludes to say the new edition in resplendent, hard binding maintains its stellar reputation of a handy list of general subject headings both for applications and a teaching resource.

AB	Body image is a construct that has been widely studied, particularly with regard to image perception and dissatisfaction. Though most research studies focus on adolescence and adulthood, dissatisfaction problems are manifesting themselves at increasingly early ages. The aim of this study was, therefore, to analyse the most significant findings on body dissatisfaction and body-size perception among children aged 3 to 6 (second cycle of pre-school education). To this end the Medline, SportDiscus, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Dialnet, ProQuest and EBSCO databases were used, and from which a total of 22 studies were selected in accordance with exclusion criteria such as language, peer review and the objective measurement of the body mass index (BMI) of children. In terms of levels of dissatisfaction, results vary widely, making it impossible to draw sound conclusions on the nature and prevalence of this variable at these ages. The main reasons for this include the type of instrument used and the difficulties children had in perceiving their bodies correctly.

AB	Given the complex surgical scenario observed today, it is necessary to change the urgent definition of a specific ontology, especially in terms of aging. The interventions of the Specialist Nurse in Rehabilitation Nursing to the person in the surgical process are primordial for the maintenance of the functional capacities, prevention of complications and impediment of incapacities. However, it is necessary to provide individualized and fostered care in a practice of excellence, and the consequent organized reading of records of an aging ontology for decision making on rehabilitation indicators. Method: a systematic review of the literature was carried out using the EBSCO host (MEDLINE with Full Text, CINAHL Plus with Full Text and MedicLatina), using the PI [C] O method, and 11 articles were selected. Results: 41 indicators were identified to be included in the ontology classes of aging: pain control, patient and family education, support and communication, reduction of postoperative complications, gain of functionality, restoration of physical function, mobility, multidisciplinary intervention and the frequency of interventions. Conclusion: it is considered that it was imperative to identify sensitive indicators for rehabilitation nursing care, based on scientific evidence and thus provide an opportunity for nurses to reflect on their daily practices and conduct their actions towards excellence in care, to propose a set of 41 classes internationally on the ontology of aging.

AB	With the increase in the average life expectancy, the appearance of chronic diseases and, in particular, in the respiratory forum and its disadvantages in the autonomy and self-care of patients, brought an important paradigm for health care and, in particular, rehabilitation nursing, with implications for the development of ontologies of aging. Thus, it is imperative to systematize them in scientifically measurable indicators to demonstrate the benefit that rehabilitation nursing brings to improve patients' quality of life, thus ensuring excellence. Each area of scientific health should contribute to the construction of aging ontology. Objective: to identify indicators sensitive to nursing care of rehabilitation, in terms of self-care, in relation to those with respiratory pathology, to be integrated into the ontology of aging. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the EBSCO (full-text MEDLINE, CINAHL, Full-Text Plus, British Nursing Index), using the PI [C] O method with 6 emergent articles. Results: A total of 20 indicators were identified, including: Ability to perform activities, increase physical and functional independence, symptom management, reduction of complications, increase in quality of life, which can be allocated as a proposal for classes of the aging ontology. Conclusion: Knowledge of indicators sensitive to nursing care recognition of the importance of rehabilitation nursing in increasing self-care and autonomy for people with respiratory pathology, and research in this area is fundamental for its effectiveness and efficiency, and its integration in the ontologies of aging is fundamental.

AB	The types of support that the family of a child with Down syndrome (DS) gives or receives can positively affect family coping and influence the child's development. In 2012, one of the authors had the privilege of working as the tutor of a boy with DS who was one year old. The opportunity of sharing with the boy day after day for almost three years and the commitment of his family in his development were the motivation for exploring the types of support which families with a DS child give or receive. Hence, besides showing the current investigation trend in the field, this study aimed to present an upto date literature review that collects publications of the last ten years. Additionally, the researchers examined the need of emotional, instrumental, informational or companionship support given by the child's family, professionals, other families of children with DS and other support networks. For this purpose, the authors explored ERIC, SCOPUS, WOS, DIALNET PLUS, EBSCO databases and DOWN Magazine for studies published between 2006 and 2016. A total of 30 studies were retrieved for the analysis. The publications were selected with the use of inclusion and exclusion criteria. For instance, selected articles appeared as complete documents in Spanish, English, French, Portuguese or German. Also, included articles focused on the support that families of a child with DS gives or receives, inter alia. Findings revealed there was emotional, instrumental and companionship support in family's support towards children with DS. However, in professionals' support towards the families of children with DS, there has been a lack of instrumental and informational support. Whilst in other families with children with DS's support and in other networks' support towards the family, there was emotional, instrumental and companionship support. Furthermore, after this study, the authors decided to inquire on parents' positive expectations, as a potentially influential attitude in the parents of a child with DS. Therefore, future research will focus on parental positive expectations which foster global development enhancement of the child with DS.

PD	2018
PY	2018
AB	The purpose of this article was to review the existing literature on parental influence in sport. The following databases were used to collect the articles: Academic Search Complete, SPORTDiscus, PsychInfo, Education Research Complete, ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, EBSCO, and SCOPUS. After a careful selection of the articles and a rigorous analysis of them, we obtained 52 empirical articles on the subject matter eligible for analysis. The results highlight the existence of two distinct perspectives of analysis: a descriptive vision which focus on the characterization of parental influence and the respective behaviours adopted by parents in sport, and another perspective focused on the relationship between parental influence and the athlete's behavioural responses. The critical analysis of the articles allowed the identification of potential methodological obstacles that is necessary to overcome in future studies, as well as possible guidelines to explore in further research in this field.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the efficacy of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore digital library search engine to return relevant materials on information visualization pedagogy literature and to recommend search strategies to assist the digital library academic readership improve the efficacy of their search tasks. Furthermore, the results are of interest to general readers using similar digital repositories.Design/methodology/approach An initial scoping review using EBSCO Discovery services returned the number and accessibility of sources and publications-based various Boolean searches. A revised search strategy focused the search to IEEE publications as the primary source of visualization research. A corpus of keywords were extracted from the 44 relevant articles and analyzed for relevance, keyword trends and contexts of use.Findings Keyword analysis results show visualization education research is confounded by several information retrieval issues: relevancy, incomplete taxonomy, non-standard lexicon, diverse disciplines and under-representation. Recommendations include: search strategies, alternative digital collections, a potential opportunity for research in information visualization pedagogy to address this gap in an emerging field and the need for more effective interactive tools to assist with keyword selection.Research limitations/implications The study focused on the IEEE publications as the primary source of visualization research.Practical implications A repository of visualization education research that is easily findable and relevant benefits both faculty using information visualization in their teaching and academics whose work must be disseminated to the broadest audience. Strategic keyword selection, interactive keyword tools or more robust thesaurus will enable IEEE Xplore digital library users to optimize their interaction with the system. Furthermore, results suggest a need for more research in information visualization pedagogy.Originality/value This is the only study to uniquely assess the efficacy of the IEEE Xplore digital library database system to retrieve relevant visualization education literature based on keyword search.

AB	Purpose: To identify all types of sales force control systems in the academic literature, and to cluster the mediators between these controls and the performances, according to the AMO model (abilities, motivations, and opportunities), analysing how each of these three groups of mediators are influenced by control systems, and how they impact on the sales performance, using a systematic literature review.Design/methodology: Scientific papers published during the last 32 years, using as databases: Business Source Premier (EBSCO), Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Business, Management and Social Sciences were taken as selection fields. False positives identification, exclusions after reading the abstracts, and after reading the whole article, was performed by the authors by consensus. 114 articles of the initial selection of non-repeated references, together with 28 additional citations integrated the final selection.Findings: A new framework based on a grouping of mediators between the control systems and the performances, into abilities, motivations and capabilities is proposed.Practical implications: These findings suggest as a managerial contribution, that coaching and leading - rather than commanding-to be a more appropriate control attitude, especially when the salesperson is younger or unexperienced.Originality/value: As academic result, the review highlights that all three groups from the AMO model evidence positive impacts on sales performance when a behavioral control system (mostly from the capability part) is in use, by enhancing salesperson's skills, motivation, and organizational conditions and support, fostering as a result, a salesperson relational approach and a customer orientation, which generate the best outcomes in the long term.

AB	Purpose: The aim of this article is to elucidate the state of B-to-B marketing research in France by conducting a review of theoretical and empirical studies in this field that have been published over the last three decades.Methodology/approach: Authors identified relevant literature sources, and proceeded with classifying the publications according to their main theme of study (as determined by reviewing the topic, the abstract, and/or keywords). To extract the main articles, authors explored multiple electronic databases, including Source Premier (EBSCO), Elsevier Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Cairn.info. This methodology has allowed comparisons both in time and in relation to similar works done in other countries. The analysis focuses on the main contributions of French literature in the B-to-B domain and establishes that progress has been made in understanding the issues of B-to-B marketing in France, as well as in the development of the theory in this field.Findings: The review shows that B-to-B marketing research in France, although under-represented in relation to its B-to-C counterparts, is gradually emerging from the shadows and covers important topics that are increasingly diverse and varied. By identifying the main topics studied by French B-to-B marketing researchers, this work advances this academic discipline while also providing valuable information.Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to conduct an in-depth examination of the state of B-to-B marketing research in France. Findings yielded by this literature review would be beneficial to both B-to-B marketing researchers and practitioners and promotes this research field.

AB	Washington State University was the first library system of its 39-member consortium to migrate to Primo New User Interface. Following this migration, we conducted a usability study in July 2017 to better understand how our users fared when the new user interface deviated significantly from the classic interface. From this study, we learned that users had little difficulty using basic and advanced search, signing into and out of primo, and navigating their account In other areas, where the difference between the two interfaces was more pronounced, study participants experienced more difficulty. Finally, we present customizations implemented at Washington State University to the design of the interface to help alleviate the observed issues.

AB	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the dimensions of service quality used in different countries across the world, especially in the higher education sector.Design/methodology/approach Content analysis is used to get a comprehensive insight of the studies accumulated from some of the selected databases such as Emerald Insight, Ebsco ABI/inform, etc. All these studies are related to the measuring of service quality in higher education.Findings The result of this paper reveals that SERVQUAL is the most widely accepted scale which has its dominance in the higher education setting. The paper focuses on revealing the dimensions which are used in the past studies. The paper notices a huge variation in the items as well as constructs while exploring the dimensions. Further, it is observed that many of the studies considered in this paper picked dimensions from other studies, expert opinions and factor analysis. In addition to this, it is found that different scales are proposed and checked for their reliability and validity through the confirmatory factor analysis. Few studies confirm the validity using average variance extracted (AVE), model fit values and correlations.Practical implications The study will help other researchers to get a summarised form of different dimensions used in the higher education setting. It also points out the essential and common dimensions of similar studies. Further, with different samples and geographical location, it can help us to identify how the dimension varies as we move from one part to another around the globe with different samples. Further, it formulates directions to pick correct combination of scale, administration and methods that are useful in collecting the data and getting the inference out of it under correct settings.Originality/value The summarisation of different studies will help the researchers to have a holistic view of the important studies that took place in the higher education setting.

AB	In contrast with the recent increase in the use of photography as a therapeutic tool in psychological settings, lack of clarity exists regarding this intervention modality. While the distinction among Photo Therapy, Therapeutic Photography, and Photo Art Therapy is theoretically established we examined whether this classification is confirmed also in practice. Electronic databases (PsychINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Social Sciences Abstracts-EBSCO) were systematically searched for studies published in the last fifteen years utilizing photographic techniques as the elective method of intervention. A total of 124 articles were identified, of which 21 met the inclusion criteria. Results indicate that photography has been used in health, clinical, social, and community settings. Photovoice, Photographic Self-Portrait, and Photo Presentation are the methods most commonly implemented. Several contributions could be placed in more than one of the above-mentioned models of intervention; suggesting that the criteria to assign articles to each model are difficult to apply when the models are put into practice.

AB	Purpose - This paper aims to explore knowledge management (KM) literature to understand the relationships among different KM practices and organizational performance (OP) in terms of the four balanced scorecard (BSC) outcomes, i.e. learning and growth, internal process, customer satisfaction and financial performance, as a measure of OP.Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of peer-reviewed journal articles has been carried out of theoretical and empirical articles to understand the linkages between KM practices and OP, accessed mainly through sources, such as ProQuest, EBSCO host, Google Scholar and other e-databases. Measures of OP have also been extracted from the literature and grouped under the four BSC outcomes to gauge the gravity of the effect. An integrated conceptual framework helps to explore the relationship between the said variables.Findings - This study provides a conceptual model of the effect of various KM practices on different aspects of OP measured through BSC. It contributes to organizations by helping them understand the importance of integration of the KM efforts to obtain desirable results. It will, for the first time, put the entire organization in perspective and help managers draw a bigger picture to understand the overall effect of KM practices.Research limitations/implications - First, the KM practices shortlisted for this research are extensive but the list may not be exhaustive. Second, the model is not empirically proved. Findings of the study would help in creating a roadmap to enhance performance by a successful implementation of KMpractices.Originality/value - This paper contributes to KM literature by adding the fact that KMpractices not only affect learning and growth perspective of an organization but also have far-reaching effects on OP in terms of customer service perspective, internal process perspective and financial perspective.

AB	The Main Library of the University of Science and Technology in Bydgoszcz joined in 2017 the first nationwide survey of user satisfaction of scientific libraries. The entire library services and the following elements of the library were evaluated: printed collections, electronic collections, opening hours, equipment, housing conditions, employees, loan rules, information services, educational offer, the use of computers and the Internet in the library, the use of copying devices and website.The aim of the conducted evaluation studies was to determine the satisfaction index, which will allow to determine the level of user satisfaction with the library services. Benefits for the library resulting from participation in the study include, among others identification of areas of functioning that need improvement, the possibility of preparing activities aimed at changing the image of the library, effective planning of its activities or the possibility of comparing the results of research with other libraries with a similar profile.The evaluation study was conducted based on the evaluation criterion - effectiveness. The implementation of the research allowed to formulate answers to key evaluation questions.Is the Main Library assuring the effectiveness of activities?Is the training policy implemented, if so, does it ensure the development of the potential of research and teaching staff and students?Are the tools planned in the promotion and information process adequate to the expectations of potential users?Are the current information and promotion activities effective?In accordance with the evaluation standards and the requirements of the implementation of evaluation studies, the survey carried out for the needs of the study was based on a questionnaire which was carried out by the management department of the Main Library. The analysis of statistics on the use of UTP e-resources in 2015-2017 was made. In the first stage of the evaluation, an analysis of the available documents, which are essential for the proper functioning of the Main Library, was analyzed, including a detailed analysis of the library user satisfaction survey conducted by the Main Library in 2017. The study included an individual free interview with the director and deputy director.The research indicated that the Main Library in the use of electronic resources ensures the effectiveness of the operation in a low degree, while in the scope of printed resources in a very low one, respectively. However, it can be noted that the number of logins to the bases is systematically growing, eg to the WoS database in 2015 the number of logins was 5541 and in 2017. 8541, and the number of logins in the analyzed period increased by 49% to the EBSCO database. On the other hand, the number of downloaded files from electronic magazines was decreasing. The library offers access to 10 magazines and so in 2015. About 81 thousand downloads, and in 2017. 63 thousand downloads. The research indicated that the number of trainings conducted in 2016. was 34, and in 2017. 44 trainings, this enabled training of 1732 people and 2011 persons respectively. Considering the team's involvement, it can be concluded that promotional activities are carried out systematically but require clarification and referral to appropriate groups of potential recipients. The conducted evaluation study in the scope of the Main Library's activity indicated the necessity to make changes. For proper functioning, a strategy should be created for the University's Main Library. The prepared strategy should be the result of consultation with the entire team of employees. The library should respond to the needs of employees and students to all kinds of information to minimize the dissonance between what it can offer and the readers' requirements.

AB	Value investing (VI) is an approach to fully risk capital allocation attributed to Graham and Dodd in 1934. Over the years, Value Investing has been referred corporate finance studies and the stock market recent literature (e.g. Chee, 2013; Calandro 2014; Duong 2014; Asness 2015; Chen, 2017).Regarding the past and focusing on the literature, we have found different main approaches to value investing: (1) Graham and Dodd (1934); (2) Fisher (1958); (3) Fama and French (1992); (4) Lakonishok et al. (1994) and (5) Damodaran (2012). Four out of five of these approaches have been developed in various periods and different economic-financial contexts and many contributions are written about Value Investing. Despite this attention, it is necessary to understand if the different approaches to VI are still working in the post-financial crisis years.Therefore, this paper aims to provide a Systematic Literature Review (SRL) about Value Investing in the current scenario, in order to better highlight the position of different Authors in relation to the main approaches of study previously introduced. A Systematic Literature Review was used, because this method allowed the sample of publications to be examined in a systematic way (e.g. Petticrew, 2001; Tranfield et al., 2003; Pittaway et al., 2004). The use of the SLR method is helpful in order to improve the knowledge of the topics analysed in the academic field, in particular to locate, appraise and synthesize the most recent contribution on VI. Through a systematic review of the literature from 2007 to 2017 (namely the years post financial crises), 45 paper were identified and analyzed, through the Ebsco Host database, to give us a better understanding of the approaches and methodologies adopted in the past studies.This search highlights 24 out of 45 papers that, directly or indirectly, have used one the main approach od study, identified in the previously literature in the last ten years (2007-2017). In particular, the results that came out is that:10 out of 24 follow the Graham's approach;10 out of 24 follow the Lakonishok and Fama-French' approaches; and4 out of 24 do not follow, directly or indirectly, one of the main approaches identified. Furthermore, referring to the methodologies, ten papers use an empirical quantitative method, nine use an empirical qualitative method (case study/multiple case study) and five use a desk qualitative method.Analyzing the paper, the main gap that we have highlighted in our study is that none of the various Authors analyzed, take into consideration the "Economic moat". This last element can be defined as a firm's competitive advantage derived as a result of various business strategies/elements (cost advantages, switching costs, efficient scale, intangible assets and network effects) that allow companies to earn above-average profits for a sustainable period. Companies that have strong "Economic moat" tend to show solid financial performance and rising returns on capital over time (e.g. Ferrari, 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first study on Value investing that systematically reviews the literature. The literature is arranged in such a way as to provide a contribution on what has been written in the last ten years on the topic, where it has been applied and the possible future lines of research.

AB	Work family balance (WFB) is an individual's perception of the fit between work and family roles. Among employed parents of typically developing children WFB has been demonstrated to impact work functioning and physical and psychological health. Emerging from this mature field of research are examinations of WFB among parents of children with disabilities.Our objective was to identify research to conduct a review and examine the expectation that individual and organizational factors impact WFB among employed parents of children with disabilities. Also, we identify existing research gaps in the literature, discuss how existing policies may need to be altered to better assist employed parents of children with disabilities, and identify ways practitioners can better assist these families.We searched PsycInfo, EBSCO Host Web, and Proquest Central for English-language articles and dissertations. To obtain additional studies, we searched identified studies' reference lists. We used the same databases to search for studies published by authors who have already published on WFB among parents of children with disabilities. Fifty-four studies examining WFB among employed parents of children with disabilities were identified.Individual factors that had an impact on WFB were child age, number of children, childcare availability, relationship status, perception of one's work role, and type and severity of the child's disability. Organizational factors that had an impact on WFB were supervisory support, workplace policies, and organizational culture.The extant research of WFB among employed parents of children with disabilities indicates that numerous variables impact these individuals' WFB.

AB	This literature review presents the current state of research on structured on-the-job training (S-OJT) and proposes a research agenda for future research activities on this form of workplace learning. In the past three decades, S-OJT has emerged as an integral part of human resource development practice. The literature review seeks to identify the nature of S-OJT as it is described in the literature, categorize the existing research and practices of S-OJT, provide overview of three dimensions (audience, location, and conclusion) of each study involving S-OJT, and develop a conceptual framework for conducting research on S-OJT. Online databases including Business Source Premier & Complete, Academic Source Premier, Scopus, Primo Articles, JSTOR, and ERIC were used for the reviews. The results of this literature review provide a theoretical framework for understanding S-OJT as a means to promote future research and theory building.

AB	This article analyses cosmopolitan imagination and ambivalent morality at times of urban crisis. It focuses on #LondonIsOpen - the city's media campaign in response to the nation's Brexit vote. In this case, cosmopolitanism's discursive tools - especially the ideals of the Open city and hospitality - are mobilised to summon a range of actors in defence of the city. The article analyses the mediation of cosmopolitanism in a campaign film and in Londoners' online and offline responses to it. These responses reveal #LondonIsOpen as a compelling example of cosmopolitan imagination, but also of cosmopolitanism's moral fragility in the neoliberal city. As shown, urban dwellers overwhelmingly embrace the cosmopolitan value of openness. Yet, their visions are divided between neoliberal cosmopolitanism and vernacular cosmopolitanism. By analysing the moral space of mediated cosmopolitanism, I argue that, unlike the nation, representational struggles in the city increasingly take place within, rather than against, cosmopolitanism.

AB	The large amounts of data used nowadays have motivated research and development in different disciplines in order to extract useful information with a view to analyzing it to solve difficult problems. Data mining and machine learning are two computing disciplines that enable analysis of huge data sets in an automated manner. In this paper, we give an overview of several applications using these disciplines in education, particularly those that use some of the most successful methods in the machine learning community, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian learning and instance-based methods. Although these two areas of artificial intelligence have been applied in many real-world problems in different fields, such as astronomy, medicine, and robotics, their application in education is relatively new. The search was performed mainly on databases such as EBSCO, Elsevier, Google Scholar, IEEEXplore and ACM. We hope to provide a useful resource for the education community by presenting this review of approaches.

AB	Positive health focuses on enhancing health along with curing illness to bring about well-being. Treatment for physical illness generally involves drug therapy, while the psycho-social aspects, specifically the positive psychology perspectives, are largely ignored; nevertheless, a growing number of investigations are now studying the effects of positive psychology interventions on health outcomes. The objective of this paper is to systematically review positive psychology interventions in chronic physical illness. A literature search through the databases of EBSCO, PubMed and PsycINFO, reference lists of significant papers and grey literature was conducted following four criteria set for this review. The number of studies selected finally that acceded to the criteria was 14. These studies were analysed by focusing on the study characteristics, kinds of intervention and outcomes of positive psychology interventions. Overall findings reveal that different intervention programmes have been devised by combining various exercises, writing is the most commonly used method for administration and positive psychology interventions are considered feasible and acceptable by patients, but findings about their usefulness are inconclusive. Suggestions for future research, clinical practice and application in communities have been provided which may be useful for clinicians, practitioners and caregivers.

AB	In the knowledge-based economy, there is a growing realisation among policy makers that knowledge assets, besides the tangible assets of financial capital and local infrastructure, are the prime creators of wealth. Given the developmental challenges facing South Africa and contemporary global societies, it is clear that Knowledge Management (KM) should not only be seen as a tool for organisational effectiveness, but also as a developmental strategy for nations and societies. As South Africa is developing policies and strategies to overcome its developmental challenges and also to remain competitive in the new global knowledge-based economy, the question that ought to be answered is: To what extend does research on KM address developmental issues in South Africa? This paper adopts a quantitative approach using bibliometric analysis to investigate the extent of research on KM on developmental targets in South Africa. A bibliometric study was conducted using four EBSCO-hosted databases to extract relevant data. It was noted that there has been continued growth in the number of KM publications in South Africa focusing on a variety of subject areas; limited researcher attention has been paid to KM for development (KM4D) and most of the research on KM4D addresses quality education and infrastructure, unemployment and economic growth. The study advocates for the need for academic institutions and research organisations to devote considerable attention to research that enhances the application and integration of the effectiveness of KM in South Africa's development as the country strives to achieve its development goals.

AB	Studies involving social media have focused on analyzing how companies can propagate information or how the social media tools can affect user behavior. Few studies have paid attention to User-Generated Content and its application to the improvement of business processes, even though there has been an increase in reported cases in recent years. Through a systematic mapping study of the Ebsco database, we looked for articles that addressed this issue of user-generated content since its first appearance of up to 2015. In a first view, we confirmed the paucity of research related to this theme, even with the large increase of social media studies. As findings, we identified some important research trends towards public organizations using the content created by citizens to improve public services, as well as companies using social media tools to improve innovation processes. On the other hand, we identified gaps in the research, such as in journalism, engaging readers as information providers, and social media, being used for the improvement of the e-learning process.

AB	PURPOSE: To explore knowledge and skill acquisition outcomes related to learning physical examination (PE) through computer-assisted instruction (CAI) compared with a face-to-face (F2F) approach.METHOD: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis published between January 2001 and December 2016 was conducted. Databases searched included Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, ERIC, Ebsco, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies were synthesized by study design, intervention, and outcomes. Statistical analyses included DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.RESULTS: In total, 7 studies were included in the review, and 5 in the meta-analysis. There were no statistically significant differences for knowledge (mean difference [MD] = 5.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.05 to 12.84) or skill acquisition (MD = 0.35, 95% CI: -5.30 to 6.01).CONCLUSIONS: The evidence does not suggest a strong consistent preference for either CAI or F2F instruction to teach students/trainees PE. Further research is needed to identify conditions which examine knowledge and skill acquisition outcomes that favor one mode of instruction over the other.

AB	Background: Diabetes mellitus is a disease whose prevalence rises each year, making it a global health threat. In Indonesia, an estimate of 9,1 million people has diabetes mellitus. There are many herbal treatments that are said to help diabetic patients, such as cinnamon. Cinnamon is thought to be able to improve glucose uptake and insulin signalling in in-vitro and animal studies, but results of trials on humans are still highly variable. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of cinnamon as an adjuvant diabetes mellitus treatment in reducing fasting blood glucose levels. Methods: Literature search is done through PubMed (R) and EBSCO (R) database, from which one Cochrane review is found relevant. Results: From a meta-analysis in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, it is found that the reduction of fasting blood glucose caused by the usage of cinnamon as an adjuvant treatment to oral hypoglycemic agents is not significant (mean difference -0.08 [95% CI -0,34, 0,18] p = 0.55). Discussion: The result of the meta-analysis appraised is consistent with all the RCT analyzed. The six RCTs are somewhat biased with highly variable methods of interventions. This subject has potential to be studied further in high quality RCTs, due to the lacking body of evidence and methodological limitations of currently available studies. Conclusion: The available evidence is not sufficient to conclude on the effectiveness of cinnamon as a diabetes mellitus adjuvant treatment in reducing fasting blood glucose.

AB	In this evidence-based case report, the clinical question which is being studied: In patients with stroke, does the first onset of stroke in young adult affect the functional status? The search which was conducted on MEDLINE and EBSCO yielded 395 articles, and two of which have good validity, importance, and applicability regarding the clinical question. The studies observed several patients with stroke whose first onset was in young adult. The patients were observed in five years after the first onset and the functional status was measured with mRS (modified Ranking Scale) score. Regarding the clinical question, this study does not have any comparison for the prognostic factor. So the data is not served with odd ratio or relative risk, but with proportion. The proportion of good recovery patients is higher than the poor recovery patients. It could reach the proportion of 70,8%. The stroke which first onset happened in young age would have a good outcome after follow up in 5 years.

AB	Introduction: Despite being one of five medicines commonly prescribed in the United States, PPI use is deemed controversial for patients with cirrhosis. The purpose of this study is to find out causality between administrations of PPI in cirrhosis patients with ascites with incidences of SBP. Methods: A structured internet literature searching was conducted by using Cochrane, PubMed((R)), ClinicalKey((R)), and Ebsco((R)). After screening titles and abstracts by inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 original articles were found, but only 1 article was used. This meta-analysis is critically appraised for its validity, importance, and applicability. Results: PPI use in patients with cirrhosis and ascites had significant difference with an increased risk of SBP [OR= 2.17; 95% CI = 1.46- 3.23; P < 0.05] with heterogeneity study [I-2 = 85.6%]. Conclusion: PPI in patients with cirrhosis and ascites increases two times the risk of SBP.

AB	Introduction: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), as the most common compressive neuropathy, can be treated with either conservative therapy, such as oral steroid, night splinting, local steroid injection; or surgical therapy, such as carpal tunnel release. Acupuncture is one of the adjuvant therapy could be given to relieve the CTS symptoms, but there are still limited studies about its effectivity; therefore, this study aims to determine the efficacy of acupuncture therapy to relieve the CTS symptoms. Methods: Literature searching was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane, dan EBSCO Host. After screening titles and abstracts by using inclusion and exclusion criterias, two randomized clinical trials (RCT) were found, then were appraised its validity, importance, and applicability. Results: Based on two RCTs, there are clinical significant differences between control and intervention group, eventhough in some parameters there are no statistic significant differences. Conclusion: Acupunture therapy as an adjuvant therapy for CTS is encouraging but not convincing due to limited studies, also there is no standard regimen for acupuncture therapy in CTS.

AB	The purpose of this article is to address the factors that can increase the utility for customers of information databases in Iran. In order to achieve that, summarizing content analysis techniques was used. The study population consists of customers paying to use information databases in Iran. The bibliographical research has been done on utility related publications published in the 5-year period of 2011-2015, indexed on Science Direct, ProQuest and EBSCO information databases. Samples were randomly chosen from information database customers using paid services from two major information centers in Iran - University of Tehran Central library and Documentation Center and Organization for Industrial Management Library, for interviews. Results showed that the main factors affecting customer utility in using paid information databases are information needs, quality, Incentives, additional information and users' individual and social characteristics, respectively.

AB	Teaching practices, as object of study, require theoretical, methodological and empirical foundations that enable the use of approaches that suit the needs and trends of research. In this article, a review has been made about research studies published in English and Spanish from 2006 to 2016 in the DOAJ and EBSCO databases to establish the state of knowledge of the teaching practice at an international level. Thirty seven research projects were selected and analyzed. It was found that the majority of these studies, which analyzed the teaching practice, focused in teachers' action, with a qualitative approach; and the most studied moment of the teaching practices was classroom implementation. The main conclusions were: 1) traditional teaching practices prevail, 2) terms referring to teaching practices are used interchangeably and 3) student-centered conceptual references predominate.

AB	Seomara da Costa Primo (Lisbon, 1895 - Amadora, 1986) was a science university professor and a high school teacher. She was a distinguished researcher, textbook author and illustrator. She was also part of teaching associations, was once part of the press and did study missions abroad. She was a woman of her day, an intellectual that defended the active role of women in society and fought for her education, empowering herself in a men's world. Her life path demonstrates that she was part of some reference institutions of the time and dialogued in significant arenas of debate, asserting herself as a personality who also circulated internationally in scientific missions. The penumbra in which her name and life have been kept must be illuminated by re-placing her in the gallery of illustrious women who represent a time and a way of occupying the public space and put the teaching profession forward.

AB	This work analyzes the tactics of protest in the public space through aesthetic interventions, considering street-art as a means of visual resistance in claims on the violence and forced disappearance that affect the emotions and summon to the memory. Its producers are tightrope walkers who disarticulate the terms of the political and clarify them in their action in order to establish a communication through the emotions. Through their agency, they promote territorializations with a discursive function, which subvert the imposed order and foster the creation of links in a gesture of rupture with impunity, questioning and claiming on repression, in the capacity of reinterpretation and transformation towards critical reflection andthe development of new actions of protest and resistance.

AB	Faced with the questioning about what are the characteristics that the library spaces must have to be relevant to the practices and behaviors of the users of the XXI century, his study establishes as a general objective to identify the main characteristics of the scientific literature that refers to the Subject of post-occupancy evaluation in libraries in the last ten years. In order to achieve the established objective, a systematic review of the literature referring to post-occupancy evaluation studies in libraries was carried out in the following languages: English, Spanish and Portuguese, published between 2006-2016, in the Academic Search Complete of EBSCO, Web of Science (WOS), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Network of Scientific Journals of Latin America and the Caribbean (REDALyC), DIALNET, INFOBILA, Google and Google Scholar. The results show that there is a balance between the theoretical and empirical studies on the subject that are carried out mainly by architects and librarians in both university and public libraries, as well as the use of different methods and techniques in their implementation. The conclusions emphasize the importance of this type of studies for the improvement of the use of spaces and the optimization of the resources invested in the construction or remodeling of libraries, as well as of the collaborative and interdisciplinary work to carry them out.

AB	The following study measures the impact of consistent and sustained oral interaction with native speakers of the target language via remote interaction on macro-linguistic skills of adult learners studying Spanish as a second language at intermediate stages of acquisition. This investigation overcomes deficiencies in previous and current research that focuses primarily on individual learners, acquisition of one grammar point or the use of specific micro-behaviors, as opposed to looking holistically at the impact that interaction with native speakers of the target language has on learners' reading, writing, speaking and listening skills at intermediate stages of acquisition. Participants of this study belonged to either the TalkAbroad-7 group (TA-7G) or the TalkAbroad-2 group (TA-2G). Using the Avant Stamp Test, learners' macro-language skills (i. e., reading, writing, listening and speaking) were quantitatively measured before and after treatment, following a pre/posttest design. Results of the data suggest that consistent and sustained oral interaction with native speakers of the target language significantly impacted learners' listening skills, while also contributing to the development of other macro-linguistic skills.The pedagogical implications of our research, combined with those available in earlier investigations, suggest that a greater focus be placed on listening tasks that build learners' aural skills. Educators and administrators alike should consider curricular changes that require learners to use interactive programs that allow them (i.e., learners) to engage in consistent and sustained oral interaction with NSTL in order to cultivate this fundamental ability.

AB	Chinese academic libraries have been devoting great effort into introducing next-generation online public access catalogs (OPACs) in order to provide a better user experience. However, there is a lack of empirical research on their usage. In this study, a transaction log file from a typical next-generation OPAC, the Wuhan University Library OPAC, formed the basis for an investigation of users' information behavior, using a clickstream data analysis framework. The 26,732,368 clickstream records in the original log file were cleaned, parsed, coded, then analyzed at the footprint, movement, and pathway levels. The results showed that the users relied heavily on the single-box simple search interface, seldom involved themselves in an exploratory search process, and preferred page navigation over search refinement when interacting with search results. The OPAC was used as a lookup tool to locate known academic resources and as a personal information management tool to utilize basic library services, instead of as a discovery tool as intended.

AB	With particular reference to educational services for children, the ability to reflect on practice in a participatory way is presented as the peculiar characteristic of a responsible educational team. The dynamics that characterize a responsible educational team are detailed with reference to the concepts of "rational working group" (Bion, 1961) and "educational group identity" (Savio, 2011). The conditions that foster the pedagogically responsible operation of an educational team are therefore defined, taking up the systemic levels of Bronfenbrenner (1979) theory and putting the role of pedagogical coordinator in the foreground, for each system level (macro, meso, eso, micro). This clarification will highlight the training role of the pedagogical coordinator to the extent that, by supporting the dynamics that characterize responsible educational team, it also supports the construction of pedagogical knowledge, the growing awareness about the educational identity and the strengthening of professional intentionality in both individual and group levels.

AB	Objective : To systematically review the effect of psychosocial interventions on improving QoL, depression and anxiety of cancer caregivers.Methods : We conducted a systematic review of psychosocial interventions among adult cancer caregivers published from 2011 to 2016. PsycINFO, PubMed, Proquest, Cochrane Library, Embase, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and EBSCO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WANFANG were searched. Inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trails (RCTs); psychosocial intervention to cancer caregivers; psychosocial health indicators including quality of life, depression or anxiety.Results : 21 studies out of 4,666 identified abstracts met inclusion criteria, including 19 RCTs. The intervention modes fell into the following nine categories: family connect intervention, self-determination theory-based intervention (SDT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), emotion-focused therapy (EFT), comprehensive health enhancement support system (CHESS), FOCUS programme, existential behavioral therapy (EBT), telephone interpersonal counseling (TIP-C), problem-solving intervention (COPE).Conclusion : paired-intervention targeting self-care and interpersonal connections of caregivers and symptom management of patients is effective in improving quality of life and alleviating depression of cancer caregivers while music therapy is helpful for reducing anxiety of cancer caregivers.

AB	The article applies the criteria used in communication analysis to the 'catalogue communication', namely to the conscious or unconscious information exchange between the catalogue and the user realized during the whole research activity. The triad sender-message-receiver can be pinpointed in libraries/librarians-search systems-users. Inspired by Paul Watzlawick's theories, five axioms of catalogue communication are introduced: 1) a search system cannot 'not' communicate, even in case of a 0 results query; 2) in addition to search results, search systems establish a meta-communication with users; 3) the communication between catalogue and user is articulated by the punctuation, that is the sequence of actions performed by the user (search, navigation, selection, etc.); 4) two communications exist: a 'digital' one, that is the data, and an 'analog' one, that is the information about the catalogue (which libraries are included, cataloguing coverage and features, etc.); 5) catalogue communication can be either symmetric, when both sender and receiver are at the same level, or complementary, when a gap of status exists.Considering the catalogue a communication tool allows an analysis by means of factors and techniques that realize an effective communication (professionalism, trust, knowledge about the audience, abilities to develop the subject, to foresee the objections, to receipt feedback, etc.) in order to improve catalogue's functionalities.

AB	Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES) pose a clinical challenge because of the diagnostic difficulty due to the complexity of their manifestations, etiology and comorbility. The aim of this paper is to outline the available psychological treatments developed to deal with PNES. To fulfill this purpose a literature search was carried out across the databases Medline, Latindex, Redalyc, Cochrane Collaboration EBSCO and Lilacs. Within the designs intended to deal with PNES, three models of psychotherapeutic approach stand out, due to the positive outcome measurements of their interventions: two cognitive-behavioral based interventions and the augmented model of Interpersonal Therapy. These findings are analyzed taking into account their methodological and clinical limitations.

AB	Troubling relationships with our parents may raise unanswered questions and anxieties. Over time, our bodies harbor these sensations in ways that often may go unrecognized. In this autoethnographic account, I examine memories of my childhood and recent past to understand emotionally disturbing episodes tainting my relationship with my father. Interrogating my reflective habits, I probe meanings left undetected by my preconceived sense-making routines. At the same time, I notice and voice the embodied resistance I encounter when opening up and deconstructing intimate layers of deeply rooted pains associated with my father. In doing so, I demonstrate how reflective practices summon a dialogue between embodied emotions and re-engagements with past understandings. Such dialogue generates potential for reimagining relational meanings and apprehending possibilities for forgiveness.

Studies and Research, who are eminent social scientists researching the issue of sport. Among them, there are many world-class professors, rectors and deans of excellent universities, founders, presidents and secretaries-general of continental and international scientific societies and editors of high-scoring journals related to social sciences focusing on sport. The journal Physical Culture and Sport. Studies and Research started its activities in 2008 and gathered many readers, distinguished authors and outstanding reviewers. It is worth taking a moment to present the profiles of the individual editors, thanks to whom the journal keeps getting better and better. The journal is increasingly appreciated internationally particular among the scientists from the humanist and social areas of investigations. The rapidly increasing number of its readers and its surprisingly wide reception, indicated by the number of visits and downloads in English-speaking countries, including hundreds of universities (up to 791 were interested in the content of issue 62 of our magazine), research institutes and related libraries, as well as academics, researchers and students, should be celebrated. These data are derived only from one bibliographic data base (EBSCO). It must be noted that the journal is indexed in 41 bases.

AB	Purpose - This paper reviews management control literature which draws on the institutional logics perspective as the theoretical lens to understand the current grounding of this perspective on management control research. It identifies gaps in the current literature and offers possible future research directions.Design/methodology/approach - For the purpose of this paper, five search engines (ABI INFORM, EBSCO, Emerald insight, JSTOR and Science Direct) were consulted, and 35 papers across 16 journals, which specifically fall within the area of management controls and institutional logics, were reviewed.Findings - The review revealed that the institutional logics perspective has provided theoretical anchoring to management control-related areas such as budgeting, performance management and control tools in organizations. The extant studies have either used institutional logics as a single theoretical perspective or have integrated it with other theories such as neo-institutional theory, agency theory and structuration theory. The research settings of the papers span across firm level, industry level and government organizations and non-profit organizations. Most of the studies have used the qualitative case study approach, whereas a few have taken the mixed method research design.Originality/value - Although there are a number of review papers in the area of management controls as well as on institutional theory in general, such reviews have not specifically been focused on the institutional logics perspective, which is a significant development within institutional theory, having provided theoretical backing to a wide range of management control studies over the years. Addressing this omission, this paper provides important insights for future researchers on what research has been done using the lens of institutional logics and what else is worth doing. In that sense, this paper contributes to the domain of management control research, as well as to the development of institutional theory in general and the institutional logics perspective in particular.

AB	Purpose - Researchers have provided critiques of teacher efficacy research along with suggestions for future research, but no recent reviews have examined the state of collective teacher efficacy (CTE) research as it relates specifically to professional development. This review addressed the following questions: How much research attention has been paid to professional learning and CTE? What does the research tell us about professional learning and CTE? What do we know about influencing CTE through professional learning? The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach - Educational Resources Information Center and EBSCO databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles written in English and published over the last ten years (between 2007 and 2017). The search terms included "collective efficacy" and "teacher or teachers" and "professional development and professional learning" and were extended beyond titles to include keywords contained within the articles. This would help to broaden the search and increase the number of hits.Findings -There is little that can be gleaned from the research related to professional learning and the contextual factors that influence collective efficacy beliefs. Only one study (Paxon et al., 2014) in this review considered the formation of CTE in relation to both remote and proximate sources. Although some of the studies explained Bandura's (1993) sources of CTE, reference to the sources were notably absent in the reported findings, implications, and conclusions of many of the studies. Contextual variables examined in the component studies included either implementation patterns, trust, sense of belonging, teacher uncertainty, opportunities for teacher leadership, social relationships, and/or labels assigned to low performing districts and/or high performing districts.Research limitations/ implications - A limitation that influences the findings of this review is that the review was not exhaustive, and articles written in English with the search terms outlined did not capture the population of possible articles. Future reviewers may uncover new patterns in CTE research by searching non-English journals and by examining the range of work completed in graduate theses and dissertations.Practical implications - In regard to promising professional learning designs, inquiry based approaches, including collaborative action research, problem-solving groups, and teams' monitoring and tracking individual student progress seemed to hold promise. In each of these designs, educators collaboratively analyze student evidence for the purpose of evaluating their impact, reflecting on their collective work, and determining optimal next steps. Interpreting results by examining student learning data might help to strengthen connections between perceived levels of difficulty related to teaching tasks and perceptions of group competence. When conversations shift from generalized talk about student's progress and polite sharing of teaching strategies to more in-depth conversations about the connections between the two, professional learning becomes more impactful. The interpretation of results, leads to shifts in causal attributions -from assumptions which included "I planned and taught the lesson, but they didn't get it" to "you haven't taught it until they've learned" as a result of engaging in these types of professional learning designs.Originality/value - Hattie's (2015) research, which synthesized major findings from over 1,200 metaanalyses relating to influences on student achievement, demonstrated the magnitude and overall distribution of more than 150,000 effect sizes. In a recent update, Hattie (2016) ranked CTE as the number one influence of all the factors related to student achievement, reporting an effect size of 1.57. This update was based on Eells' (2011) meta-analysis that synthesized correlational evidence for CTE and student achievement. Eells (2011) found that CTE was strongly and positively associated with student achievement "across subject areas, when using varied instruments, and in multiple locations" (p. 110). Eells (2011) finding is becoming more widely disseminated through the promotion of Hattie's (2016) Visible Learning Research due to its prominent position within that body of evidence. Thus, the interest of practitioners in the field, including administrators, teachers, and professional learning facilitators has been piqued. Gaining a better understanding of CTE, sources that shape it, and its antecedents and consequences are likely to surface as a major upcoming focus for designers and facilitators of professional learning. There is a small amount of extant research that examined professional development effects on teacher efficacy (Tschannen-Moran and McMaster, 2009; Ross and Bruce, 2007). However, there are many voids in the collective efficacy research. Given this void and the increased interest to gain a better understanding of CTE on part of practitioners, not only is additional research needed, it is imperative to find ways to address the ongoing dilemma of making research and theory relevant to educators' practice.

AB	This article presents findings from the first year of the Harbingers research project started in 2015. The project is a 3-year longitudinal study of early career researchers (ECRs) to ascertain their current and changing habits with regard to information searching, use, sharing, and publication. The study recruited 116 researchers from seven countries (UK, USA, China, France, Malaysia, Poland, and Spain) and performed in-depth interviews by telephone, Skype, or face-to-face to discover behaviours and opinions. This paper reports on findings regarding discovery and access to scholarly information. Findings confirm the universal popularity of Google/Google Scholar. Library platforms and web-scale discovery services are largely unmentioned and unnoticed by this user community, although many ECRs pass through them unknowingly on the way to authenticated use of their other preferred sources, such as Web of Science. ECRs are conscious of the benefits of open access in delivering free access to papers. Social media are widely used as a source of discovering scholarly information. ResearchGate is popular and on the rise in all countries surveyed. Smartphones have become a regularly used platform on which to perform quick and occasional searches for scholarly information but are only rarely used for reading full text.

AB	Antonio Drove's formal approach to film noir in La verdad sobre el caso Savolta (The Truth about the Savolta Case, 1978) clashes with virtually everything ever seen before in Spanish cinema. Critics at the time, like those today, saw it as a blend of historical fiction, thriller and political cinema in a fruitful amalgam of diverse aesthetic references, which might have opened a pathway (which was never followed) towards the renewal of the different forms of Spanish cinema during the Transition. The chaos and controversy surrounding the production of the film, clearly due to its uncomfortable left-wing orientation, highlight the fact that this historical account (of the emergence of early fascism that would lead to Primo de Rivera's dictatorship) is an unavoidable reflection of the complicated times in which it was made.The textual analysis of the film sets out to shed light on the filmmaker's intentions and the narrative strategies with which he undertook his most personal and ambitious project, using Eduardo Mendoza's novel as a basis upon which to build a discourse more strongly influenced by the work and thought of Bertolt Brecht.

AB	The objective of this study is to better understand the learning experiential model as an alternative of innovative learning in local higher education. Latin American universities have weaknesses in their educational systems in relation to the number of formulated elements, the quality of learning, the reduced differentiation of tenders; As well as the absence of systems for updating skills. All these elements affect the performance of the graduating students' professional productivity, and are the main reason to look for solutions that help eliminate these existing anomalies.This research focuses on describing the most relevant elements related to Experiential learning styles, which include high student participation. Among the main underlying elements that comprise these learning styles are: an inventory of the learning styles, the learning cycle, learning cycle stages, and the learning style grid. An approach with co-creation as an enhancer of these experiential models is also present in this research. Co-creation is an approach to marketing, through which the collaboration and participation of stakeholders involved in the production/services processes is sought. The study analyses how the addition of co-creation in university environments can contribute to the implementation of these experiential models.This methodology is based on a review of academic literature, which includes the analysis of articles and journals indexed in databases such as the ISI Web of Knowledge and EBSCO, covering a period of the past five years. Considering the enriching importance that literature reviews in the academic area possess, they have developed in the interest of strengthening existing theoretical bases as well a tool for detection of possible gaps in the field of exploration.The main contribution of this study is to have identified the positive impact of the teaching/learning strategies based on the Experiential Model in university students. The quality of the implemented methodologies as well as the development of skills highly important for future work needs have been enhanced with the implementation of these alternatives.

AB	In 2012, the Orbis Cascade Alliance library consortium, currently made up of 39 post-secondary academic institutions in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, began implementing a shared, cloud-based integrated library system (SILS): Ex Libris' Alma and Primo. As the process of onboarding institutions continued over a two-year period, efforts to support geographically disbursed collaborative work increased. This paper focuses on the tools and structures used by the consortium central staff to train, engage, and professionally develop staff at member libraries, who spend significant portions of their time doing the consortium's work in these shared applications. Successful approaches to relationship-building, accountability and recognition efforts, as well as how specific organizational structures and collaboration tools help address technical challenges are discussed.

AB	Most European countries have failed to integrate health care services. This inevitably leads to fragmented health care provision. This fragmentation results in long waiting times and involvement of multiple care providers who offer different forms of care. The lack of integration of health care seems to be one of the biggest challenges in health systems as integration calls for a holistic approach and the implementation of structural changes that are costly. The aim of the paper is to explore the nature and strategic forms of the mechanisms and tools dedicated to health care integration in selected European countries. The literature review was performed using resources of Web of Science and Ebsco. The search criteria focused on the following key words: integrated health care, care coordination, coordinated care programmes, and integration mechanisms. The time span of the analysis covered the last 20 years from 1998 to 2017. Finally, 39 studies were identified that presented the evidence-based experience with care coordination. Several strategic forms of health care integration have been identified, including structural, functional and subject-based mechanisms.

AB	Today's learners operate in digital environments which can be largely navigated with no human intervention. At the same time, libraries spend millions and millions of dollars to provide access to content which our users may never know is available to them. Through the Open SESMO (Search Engine & Social Media Optimization) database project, Montana State University (MSU) Library applied search engine optimization and structured data with the Schema. org vocabulary, linked data models and practices, and social media optimization techniques to all the library's subscribed databases. Our research shows that Open SESMO creates significant return-on-investment with substantial increased traffic to our paid resources by our users as evidenced through analytics and metrics. In the core research of the article, we take a quantitative look at the pre/post results to assess the Open SESMO method and its impact on organic search referrals and use of the collection analyzing data from three distinct fall semesters. Returns include demonstrated library value through database recommendations, connecting researchers to subject librarians, and increased visitation to our library's paid databases with growth in organic search referrals, impressions, and click-through rates. This project offers a standard and innovative practice for other libraries to employ in surfacing their paid databases to users through the open web by applying structured and linked data methods.

AB	This article reports on an effort to better understand the discoverability of ebook collections at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). Library staff analyzed titles in nine ebook packages across disciplines and conducted a two-pronged analysis of how discoverable titles in these collections were, both in Summon Discovery Service and the online catalog, and the quality of what could be discovered about the ebooks with these tools. This study revealed that discoverability of ebooks is not equal across collections, and some collections require more work to make them discoverable in Summon and the catalog. Finally, the majority of titles were discovered in Summon, but the catalog still seems to be a better discovery engine for these ebooks.

AB	Objective: The purpose of this study is to present a review of the scholarly literature development on virtual teams and to redefine the key characteristics and features of 'team virtuality' and 'virtual teams'. Even though previous literature reviews enhanced the understanding of the implications brought about by virtual teams, this study differs from earlier studies in a number of ways.Research Design & Methods: A literature review through content and citation analyses was conducted using the Web of Science, ABI/Inform and EBSCO databases in order to comprehensively explore all definitions and characteristics of the concepts of 'virtual team' and 'team virtuality'. A total of 265 articles published between 2006 and 2014 were analysed, and the details of the analyses are herein presented.Findings: The analyses reveal that the characteristics and definitions are often contradictory and rarely correspond, thereby attesting to the lack of consensus in the literature. I present a portrait that tackles the literature's focus on virtual team's geographic dispersion and its dependency on electronic communication as the core sources of virtuality, as a defining characteristic of virtuality remain to be the lack of face-to-face contact.Implications & Recommendations: The major implication is that a unified definition is proposed in order to measure virtuality more comprehensively by addressing the gap observed in past research.Contribution & Value Added: This article contributes to the literature incorporating the studies from the most extensive fields of research. After considering different approaches and dimensional constructs, it has become clear that constructing a single dimension that all research could agree upon is an insurmountable challenge due to the variations of existing definitions as outlined in this article.

AB	The appeal of Pokemon GO is in large part due to the game's introduction of locative augmented reality to popular media culture, as players' mobile phones summon virtual creatures and overlay them on the immediate environment. The significance of this novel device (within popular children's culture at least) is open to question however. The workings of imagination in children's lives have always populated mundane experience with nonactual actions and characters, and these processes have been mechanized and monetized by commercial children's culture over decades, not least in the transmedia system of Pokemon itself. What can critical attention to imagination and technology in pre- and postdigital play tell us about the hybrid realities of Pokemon GO today?

AB	This article describes a usability study of the University of Southern Mississippi Libraries website conducted in early 2016. The study involved six participants from each of four key user groupsundergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and library employees- and consisted of six typical library search tasks, such as finding a book and an article on a topic, locating a journal by title, and looking up hours of operation. Library employees and graduate students completed the study's tasks most successfully, whereas undergraduate students performed relatively simple searches and relied on the Libraries' discovery tool, Primo. The study's results displayed several problematic features that affected each user group, including library employees. These results increased internal buy-in for usability-related changes to the library website in a later redesign.

BP	147
EP	171
PD	2017

AB	Anecdotal evidence coming from everyday discussions with Hungarian lecturers points to the fact that student cheating is prevalent in Hungarian business higher education. This seemingly widespread (and often collectively practiced) student activity can not only cast a shadow on the validity of the degrees issued by Hungarian business schools, but also raises concerns about the long-term effects of cheating in terms of the operation of higher education in general. Based on semi-structured interviews conducted with students and lecturers of a Hungarian business school, in this paper we aim to map the attributions of these key stakeholders in relation to the specific causes and effects of cheating. The aims of the paper are twofold. Firstly, to provide a detailed account of the main causes and effects appearing in the social scientific discourse. Therefore, the paper provides a short literature review summarising the most important studies dealing with the causal factors of cheating published between 1990 and 2016 (based on a search in JSTOR and EBSCO). The paper's second aim is to compare these features of the relevant literature with so-called ` practice'. In order to do so, under the umbrella of an ongoing research project, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholder groups in higher education, namely with lecturers and students in a Hungarian business school. As far as data analysis is concerned, the process has three stages. As a first step, we map the causal connections identified by the interviewees, or-to utilise the social-psychological terminology-we highlight their attributions in relation to cheating. Then, we visualise these attributions by drawing causal diagrams, which illustrate the perceived causes and effects of cheating. Lastly, we compare two diagrams-one based on students' and one based on lecturers' answers-reflecting on both their similarities and differences. In the final part of the paper, we compare the key findings of the literature review with the experiences and perceptions of the key stakeholders regarding both causes and the short and long-term effects of cheating. Moreover, we connect the results to the wider social and political context, especially focusing on Hungarian values and beliefs.

AB	Problem Statement: Self-regulated learning strategies (cognitive, metacognitive, resource management, and motivational strategies) influence students' academic achievement, conceptual understanding, and motivation. Reviewing the national literature about self-regulated learning strategies, studies have indicated both significant and insignificant effects on academic achievement; however, no meta-analysis studies have been carried out. Purpose of Study: The aim of this study is to calculate the common effect size of empirical and relational studies conducted in Turkey between 2005-2014 that investigated the effect of (or relationship with) self-regulated learning strategies on academic achievement, and to determine whether the common effect size shows a significant difference in terms of course type, self-regulated learning strategy type, school level, and study design. Method: A metaanalytical review method was employed to combine the outcome of independent empirical or relational studies. The studies included in this review were collected from the CoHE National Thesis Archive, ULAKBIM, Google Academic, ERIC, and EBSCO databases. A total of 47 studies were assessed in accordance with the inclusion criteria, and 21 studies were included in this study. Cohen's d coefficient was calculated for the effect size in this study. Findings and Results: As the heterogeneity among the effect sizes of the studies was high (Q > chi(2), p < .05), the common effect size was calculated in accordance with the random effects model. As a result of the meta-analysis, it was determined that self-regulated learning strategies had a "large" effect (d = 0.859) on academic achievement. Moreover, the calculated common effect size showed no significant difference according to the type of self-regulated learning strategy, course type, study design, and school level. Recommendation: As self-regulated learning strategies exhibit a substantial effect on students' academic achievement, it is recommended that preservice and in-service teachers should learn how to implement these strategies in their lessons to increase their students' performance. For this purpose, professional development programs should be designed for teachers. (C) 2017 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved

AB	Objective - To discover whether users can effectively complete common research tasks in a modified Primo Discovery System interface.Design - Usability testing.Setting - University of Houston Libraries.Subjects - Users of the University of Houston Libraries Ex Libris Primo Discovery System interface.Methods - The researchers used a think aloud usability test methodology, with participants asked to verbalize their thought processes as they completed a set of tasks. Four tasks were developed and divided into two task sets (Test 1 and Test 2), with session facilitators alternating sets for each participant. Tasks were as follows: locating a known article, finding a peer reviewed article on a requested subject, locating a book, and finding a newspaper article on a topic. Tests were conducted in front of the library entrance using a laptop equipped with Morae (screen and audio recording software), and participants were recruited via an assigned "caller" at the table offering library merchandise and food as a research incentive. Users could opt out of having their session recorded, resulting in a total of fifteen sessions completed with fourteen recorded. Thirteen of the 15 participants were undergraduate students, one was a graduate student, one was a post-baccalaureate student, and there were no faculty participants. Facilitators completed notes on a standard rubric, coding participant responses into successes or failures and noting participant feedback.Main Results - All eight participants assigned Test 1 successfully completed Test 1, Task 1: locating a known article. Participants expressed a need for an author limiter in advanced search, and had difficulty using the citation formatted information to locate materials efficiently. Again, all eight participants found an article on the requested subject in Test 1, Task 2, but two were unable to determine if the article met peer review requirements. One participant used the peer-reviewed journals facet, while the rest attempted to determine this using the item record or with facilitator help. All seven participants in Test 2 were able to locate the book requested in Task 1 via title search, but most had difficulty determining what steps to take to check that book out. Five participants completed Test 2, Task 2 (finding a newspaper article on a topic) unassisted, one completed it with assistance, and one could not complete it at all. Five users did not notice the Newspaper Articles facet, and no participants noticed resource type icons without facilitator prompting.Conclusions - The researchers, while noting that there were few experienced researchers and a narrow scope of disciplines in their sample, concluded that there were a number of clear barriers to successful research in the Primo interface. Participants rarely used post-search facets, although they used pre-search filtering when possible, and ignored links and tabs within search results in favour of clicking on the material's title. This led to users missing helpful tools and features. They conclude that a number of the usability problems with Primo's interface are standard discovery systems usability problems, and express concern that this has been inadequately addressed by vendors. They also note that a number of usability issues stemmed from misunderstandings of terminology, such as "peer-reviewed" or "citation." They conclude that while they have been able to make several improvements to their Primo interface, such as adding an author limiter and changing "Peer-reviewed Journals" to "Peer-reviewed Articles," further education of users will be the only way to solve many of these usability problems.

AB	Purpose - This paper aims to establish the level of use of the electronic resources at the University of Venda, which is one of the previously disadvantaged universities in South Africa. It identifies the different electronic resources used at the university, determines the level of awareness and training in the use of these resources and suggests ways in which electronic resources may be enhanced. The rapid changes in the information and communication technology (ICTs) have influenced service delivery in academic libraries in terms of how information is gathered, accessed, retrieved and used. Hence, electronic resources are invaluable research tools in academic libraries in the twenty-first century.Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research methodology was adopted, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant to get in-depth information. The target population was all third-year students registered with the School of Human and Social Sciences at the University of Venda. The third year undergraduate students from this particular school where chosen because statistics revealed that these students where ranked among the top in the use of computers.Findings - The findings revealed that the level of usage of these resources by undergraduate students is elementary and limited to SABINET and EBSCO host. Undergraduate student's level of awareness of the different electronic resources is low. They confused electronic resources to Web-based internet sources. It also revealed that the level of awareness and training in the use of these resources is still generic, as training is mostly a once off orientation at the first year.Research limitations/implications - This paper focuses on third year undergraduate students who were using computers because the researchers were interested in finding out whether students using computers were also using electronic resources. It excluded other profiles such as age, gender and computer usage behaviour of electronic resources.Practical implications - Adequate use and knowledge of electronic resources at universities is instrumental towards realisation of the country's ICT Strategy and the outcome-based education (OBE) model of teaching movement. Suggestions are made to the university, the university library, university librarians and the Library Association of South Africa on how to enhance the use of electronic resources.Originality/value - It establishes the level of use of electronic resources in one of South African historically disadvantaged universities, a point of contact to other previously South African disadvantaged universities and make suggestions on how electronic resources may be enhanced. It adds to the body of knowledge on the use of electronic resources in academic libraries in South African universities.

AB	Biobanking is an emerging medical, research, and social institution that has many implications for psychological science and practice. The bibliographic study of abstracts and full text articles retrieved from major databases (PsycInfo, PubMed, EBSCO, SAGE) indicates that the role of psychology in the establishment and functioning of biobanks is not well articulated. Two promising directions of biobank-based studies are concerned with studies of risk factors for various disorders and with genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of psychological and behavioral trait development, and are closely tied to a developing model of a new "personalized" medicine. It is important to carefully select the psychological variables and measurements, with consideration of their suitability for genetic studies, possibilities for networking and sharing of results, economic limitations, and biobank purposes. Of special importance is a systemic foundation of mental functions that requires not only the assessment of efficacy, but also the search for simple, natural, and objectively observable components. Applied tasks of professional psychologists in the field of biobanking can be defined, such as donor selection and management of ethical issues. As a new technology, biobanking poses several challenges to society and the individual that need to be studied in order to prevent misuse and to earn the public trust. The hidden dangers of eugenics-like ideas, of consumer practices with genetic products, and of over-emphasis on human enhancement are particularly stressed. We conclude that while biobanks represent a promising and fertile ground for psychological research and applications, there is a need for a comprehensive psychology of biobanking to make them fruitful.

AB	This study examines several key design elements of 37 academic library Web sites (members of the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries) and how they have changed between 2012 and 2015. While several studies have reviewed library Web sites looking for common design elements and content, the present work may be the first to look at the design elements of a large group of library Web sites over time. This study has two main goals: to present an objective analysis of the navigation and search interface designs at research university library Web sites, and to assess the usage of Web-scale discovery systems and content management systems in libraries. Other areas explored include when sites were most recently redesigned and whether sites have adopted a mobile-friendly, responsive design. Notable findings include a very high usage of Web-scale discovery systems, an increasing adoption of open source content management systems, and increasing implementation of responsive design. Also noted was a strong and growing standardization in navigation design. This study concludes with a review of the trends and discussion of current design patterns in academic library Web sites.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the status, trends and potential future research areas in the field of financial decision-making process in family firms.Design/methodology/approach - The bibliometric indicators and methods are applied in order to describe the publication activity and to analyze the contents of the articles. The material examined are the journals included in the SCOPUS, SAGE and EBSCO database and the peer-reviewed article, which contain in their titles, keywords or abstracts with a combination of phrases "family firms," "family business" or "family enterprise" with "financial decision" or one of the subcategories: capital structure, investment decision, capital budgeting, working capital management or dividend policy. The study covers the period from 2000 to 2016.Findings - Although the interest in family business research is growing rapidly, the area of financial decision making is underestimated. Despite of the fact that the vast majority of the studies into financial decisions in family firms is are focused on the capital structure, they do not give clear answers to the question of how the family businesses behave in this scope and what their true financial logic is. Additionally, the area of the investment decisions and dividend policy is rather not better left uncovered.Research limitations/implications - The analyses enable the identification of potential avenues for future research which could be vital to make an advancement in the consolidation of the discipline.Practical implications - The analyses ought to have a potential meaning mainly for external institutions (especially financial institutions) in better understanding of the family businesses and their point of view.Originality/value - This paper fulfills the need of a comprehensive review of financial decision making process in family firms. It provides a literature review and bibliography for the period between 2000 and 2016 for the use of both academicians and practitioners.

AB	Discovery tools have been widely adopted by academic libraries, yet little information exists that connects common practices regarding discovery tool implementation, maintenance, assessment, and staffing with conventions for research and instruction. The authors surveyed heads of reference and instruction departments in research and land-grant university libraries. The survey results revealed common practices with discovery tools among academic libraries. This study also draws connections between operational, instructional, and assessment practices and perceptions that participants have of the success of their discovery tool. Participants who indicated successful implementation of their discovery tool hailed from institutions that made significant commitments to the operations, maintenance, and acceptance of their discovery tool. Participants who indicated an unsuccessful implementation, or who were unsure about the success of their implementation, did not make lasting commitments to the technical maintenance, operations, and acceptance of their discovery tool.

AB	In what follows, we position our differing conceptualizations of leadership in art education adjacent to one another for readers to explore their contingent performativity. Accordingly, we are emulating the convergence of papers, ours and those of other scholars, artists, and teachers who, at the 2016 National Art Education Association Convention, addressed the theme of leadership cross-pollination. Considering that the presenters' address of this theme constituted a contingent multiplicity of artistic and scholarly perspectives suggests that the event of the conference likewise constituted an ideational assemblage and art education a field of immanent research and practice. As immanent forces, both the conference and the field of art education offered attendees opportunities to experience leadership cross-pollination from in-between and across the differing papers and presentations. It is that immanent performativity that we are inviting readers to summon as they perform an experimental reading in-between and across our two writings on the leadership-of-nonleadership in art education.

AB	Over recent years, studies have been conducted on stress in the general population but not in people with disabilities. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the impact of stress, as well as the coping strategies used by people with intellectual disabilities. 137 potential articles published between 2007 and 2016 were obtained from various databases: EBSCO host, CSIC, PubMed, Psyke, PubPsych, ERIC, Scopus and WOS. Three met the inclusion criteria. The results suggested that people with intellectual disabilities have particular difficulties in dealing with interpersonal relationships, tend to use avoidance coping strategies rather than active coping strategies, and use active strategies that are more focused on the problem than on the emotion, except in very distressing situations, in which case they employ defensive coping strategies. More studies are needed, particularly in our setting, in order to establish solid conclusions regarding the management of stress in this population.

AB	This article makes a comparative analysis of the ideological contents (identity, political culture, citizenship) of the editions of the Cyclic-Pedagogical Encyclopedia (intermediate level) of the Dalmau Carles-Pla publishing house in 1927 (Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, although the draft still corresponds to the prior Restoration), 1936 (Second Republic) and 1953 (Franco's regime). The outstanding ideological features of the 1927 edition are corporativism, elitism, a liberalism respectful of the historical constitution (Monarchy, Catholicism) and a Spanish patriotism compatible with the foralism and catalanism. Monarchism, Catholicism, corporativism, elitism, patriotism. These are all values shared by Franco's regime: the 1953 edition retains many of the previous texts although it introduces several modifications that serve to legitimize the Franco regime, root out the Catalonian nationalism and exalt Spanishheritage. The 1936 edition legitimizes the Republican legal framework, but as it preserves the corporativism, elitism, monarchism and Catholicism... from previous drafts, it does not legitimize Republican values such as freedom of conscience, secularism, social reformism. This tells us something about the difficulties involved in altering the value system imposed by the oligarchy which established the liberal regime in Spain.

Through an integrative review of operationalized literature via consultations with scientific sites of the main conference area and articles databases Science Direct, Social Science Research Network, JSTOR Archive, the CAPES Portal, Scientific Periodicals Electronic Library and EBSCO on empirical studies that measured the level of understanding of Accounting in undergraduate reading, using as criteria the time period 1974-2015, it was noted that the use of books, demonstrations, accounting standards and, more recently, audit reports and management reports is relatively present in the evaluation of comprehensibility. However, after the advent of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), few studies have been conducted, scenario that shows up not aligned the rise prominence skills underlying to judgment of substance over form and consequently, of the skills underlying the higher reading comprehension, ie, to analyze, synthesize, criticize and evaluate. Faced with such a survey, is then explored through the targeted research agenda proposition in four perspectives: refining the measurement technique; evaluation of the relationship between the difficulty of the text and the reader's capacity; relationship with academic performance measures; and determinants of students comprehensibility.

AB	Objective - To compare the usage of print and ebooks received on University of Manitoba's e-preferred YBP approval plan as well as to examine cost per use for the approval print books and ebooks.Methods - Usage data was compiled for books received on approval in 2012/2013 to December 31, 2014. Counter reports were used to determine use and non-use of ebooks, while vendor reports from EBL and ebrary were used for the cost per use analysis. Print usage information was drawn from SIRSI and then ALMA when UML switched systems at the beginning of 2014.Results - Ebooks received more use than p-books overall, but when examined by subject discipline, significant differences could not be found for the "STM" and "Other" categories. With ebooks, university press books tended to be used more than those from other publishers, but the same result was not found for print books. Ebrary ebooks tended to be used more often than EBL, EBSCO, and Wiley ebooks, and single-licence books tended to be somewhat more used than multi-user ones. Cost-per-use data was much lower for print books, though the comparison did not look at staffing costs for each medium.Conclusions - This study finds that of approval books matching the same profile, ebooks are used more, but print books receive more substantial use. Both formats are needed in a library's collection. Future comparisons of cost per use should take into account hidden labour costs associated with each medium. Usage studies provide evidence for librarians refining approval plan profiles and for budget managers considering changes to monographic acquisition methods and allocations.

AB	Objective - To compare the results of health sciences search queries in three web-scale discovery (WSD) services for relevance, duplicate detection, and retrieval of MEDLINE content.Design - Comparative evaluation and bibliometric study.Setting - Six university libraries in the United States of America.Subjects - Three commercial WSD services: Primo, Summon, and EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS).Methods - The authors collected data at six universities, including their own. They tested each of the three WSDs at two data collection sites. However, since one of the sites was using a legacy version of Summon that was due to be upgraded, data collected for Summon at this site were considered obsolete and excluded from the analysis.The authors generated three questions for each of six major health disciplines, then designed simple keyword searches to mimic typical student search behaviours. They captured the first 20 results from each query run at each test site, to represent the first "page" of results, giving a total of 2,086 total search results. These were independently assessed for relevance to the topic. Authors resolved disagreements by discussion, and calculated a kappa inter-observer score. They retained duplicate records within the results so that the duplicate detection by the WSDs could be compared.They assessed MEDLINE coverage by the WSDs in several ways. Using precise strategies to generate a relevant set of articles, they conducted one search from each of the six disciplines in PubMed so that they could compare retrieval of MEDLINE content. These results were cross-checked against the first 20 results from the corresponding query in the WSDs. To aid investigation of overall coverage of MEDLINE, they recorded the first 50 results from each of the 6 PubMed searches in a spreadsheet. During data collection at the WSD sites, they searched for these references to discover if the WSD tool at each site indexed these known items.Authors adopted measures to control for any customisation of the product setup at each data collection site. In particular, they excluded local holdings from the results by limiting the searches to scholarly, peer-reviewed articles.Main results - Authors reported results for 5 of the 6 sites. All of the WSD tools retrieved between 50-60% relevant results. EDS retrieved the highest number of relevant records (195/360 and 216/360), while Primo retrieved the lowest (167/328 and 169/325). There was good observer agreement (k=0.725) for the relevance assessment. The duplicate detection rate was similar in EDS and Summon (between 96-97% unique articles), while the Primo searches returned 82.9-84.9% unique articles.All three tools retrieved relevant results that were not indexed in MEDLINE, and retrieved relevant material indexed in MEDLINE that was not retrieved in the PubMed searches. EDS and Summon retrieved more non-MEDLINE material than Primo. EDS performed best in the known-item searches, with 300/300 and 299/300 items retrieved, while Primo performed worst with 230/300 and 267/300 items retrieved. The Summon platform features an "automated query expansion" search function, where userentered keywords are matched to related search terms and these are automatically searched along with the original keyword. The authors observed that this function resulted in a wholly relevant first page of results for one of the search questions tested in Summon.Conclusion - While EDS performed slightly better overall, the difference was not great enough in this small sample of test sites to recommend EDS over the other tools being tested. The automated query expansion found in Summon is a useful function that is worthy of further investigation by the WSD vendors. The ability of the WSDs to retrieve MEDLINE content through simple keyword searches demonstrates the potential value of using a WSD tool in health sciences research, particularly for inexpert searchers.

For this purpose, four world-known electronic databases were identified in this study. These databases are EBSCO (F = 35), Sage (F = 26), Science Direct (F = 8) and Emerald (F = 27). Generally, 96 articles were gathered from these databases about servant leadership. These articles were analyzed according to journal name, publication year, country, sample size, type of research, data collection tool(s), and data analysis method. Using the content analysis method, the frequency distribution of data, descriptive statistics, and percentage analysis were determined. When the results of the study were examined, it was concluded that the most published journal was "Leadership and Organizational Development Journal" during 2015 and 2016 in the United States. The sample size ranged from 1 to 500. To collect data, quantitative research and survey were used. Factor analysis, correlation, and regression analysis were used to analyze the obtained data.

AB	Purpose - Accessibility metadata has been a recurring theme in recent efforts aimed at promoting accessibility of information and communication technology solutions to all, regardless of their disabilities, cultural differences, language, etc. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of accessibility metadata in improving knowledge discovery and access in digital library environments, discuss developments in creating accessibility terms for resource description, and attempt to relate those developments to the overall purpose of universal design to finally recommend points for improvement.Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory study based on review of selected literature and documentations made available by metadata projects. Search for related literature was made using Google Scholar, EBSCO, and Web of Science Databases using terms and combination of terms such as "universal design and metadata," " accessibility metadata," "inclusive design," and " metadata and digital libraries." Some documentation on metadata projects were obtained through e-mail correspondences.Findings - The overall discussion shows that accessibility metadata can be instrumental in exposing accessible resources to search engines and in augmenting library resource discovery tools for the benefit of users with disabilities. Accessibility metadata would help users to quickly discover materials that fit their needs. However, the notion of indexing resources by their accessibility attributes remains an area that needs further exploration.Originality/value - The paper gives emphasis to the importance of metadata research in universal design endeavors. It also provides recommendations for practical applications that would improve accessibility in digital library environments.

Library information specialists (LIS) must also be knowledgeable of-and comfortable with-the use of the new technologies introduced. As mobile technologies continue to evolve and advance in developing countries, libraries and LIS may be best positioned to assist students and researchers in accessing information required to be proficient and productive in scholarly pursuits without physical boundaries.Practical implications - The existing research literature surveyed here implies that the growth of ICT and evolving concepts of libraries require the need for LIS training and greater understanding of the use of mobile technologies in providing academic library services.Originality/value - Academic librarians are at the forefront of providing aspiring academics and professionals with access to digital collections and e-learning courses using mobile information communication and technology devices; the implications of the research discussed in this survey of the current literature discloses a need for diverse skills for the appropriate and continuing effectiveness to support students and academic researchers.

Empirical studies undertaken by numerous scholars (Farling et al., 1999; Bass, 2000; Page and Wong, 2000; Russell and Stone, 2002; Sendjaya and Serros, 2002; Dennis and Winston, 2003; Smith et al., 2004; Stone et al., 2004; Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005; Humphreys, 2005) have surfaced significant findings supporting relevance of servant leadership in organizational context; however, an absence of universal definition and its measures impinges on this concept. Noticeably missing from research attention has been the effect of servant leadership in promoting positive organizational behaviour among organizational employees. Thus, this paper aims to explore the available literature on servant leadership with a view to establish a servant leader's role in instilling and facilitating positive organizational behaviour in the workplace. Moreover, the purpose is also to determine whether the positive organizational behaviour inculcated among the employees through a servant leader helps in reducing their turnover intentions.Design/methodology/approach - Using different keywords, relevant research papers on Google Scholar were selected. Also, several online databases like Emerald Management, Elseiver, EBSCO Host, etc., were accessed for conducting this exploratory study.Findings - To examine the various convergent and divergent dimensions of the major constructs, numerous definitions and scholarly work of renowned practitioners have been collated through an extensive literature review. To put forth a comprehensive picture encompassing the noteworthy findings of the studies pertaining to the major construct, a tabular representation has been made.Originality/value - This is the first study wherein the linkage about servant leadership and positive organizational behaviour in organizational context has been talked about. The paper carries value as the literature pertaining to servant leadership in published domain is still in its nascent stage. The repertoire of literature, presented here, will provide a clear direction to the future researchers who wish to pursue their study in this area.

AB	In 2013, after nearly two decades of operating in a distributed legacy Integrated Library System (ILS) environment on local servers, the Orbis Cascade Alliance, a consortium of public and private academic libraries in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, began a two-year-long process to migrate its 37 members to a shared implementation of Ex Libris's cloud-based Alma library management system (LMS) and Primo discovery interface. Although much has been written on electronic resource management (ERM) functionality at an institution level, little has been written on serials and ERM functionality and workflows within a shared consortial environment. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of implementing a consortial-based LMS, with particular emphasis on serials and ERM functionality. Key migration issues related to serials control, acquisitions, licensing, administration, cataloging, statistics, and interoperability are examined at the institutional and large-scale networked levels. Benefits and limitations of using a shared consortial cloud-based LMS are explored, and the overall capabilities of the Alma LMS for electronic resource management are reviewed.

AB	This paper presents results of a study that aimed to analyze the conceptions of Science, scientist's profile and scientific development of High School's students through activities based on so-called short story "Excellent is the Water" by Primo Levi. Its contents promote the discussion about the importance of breaking the empirical-inductive view of science as well as the importance of error in scientific development. The Bachelard's epistemology guided the study using as a data collection instrument a questionnaire composed of open questions answered by students at the end of the activity. The main contribution of this study relates to the generated reflections and contradictions and understanding of the importance of considering the error in the construction of science and the scientific development.

AB	This research is aimed to improve the flow management of the government debt in Latvia, its connection to the current Latvian government debt model and to define future improvement directions of the current Latvian government debt model. During the research the structuring of the current model, that is the model with the main function of finance attraction and payment of the coupon and is the bases of government debt coverage, is made. The main weakness of the current model is connected to the main goal that all resources are attracted only for government budget deficit coverage and no other functions are fulfilled. As in the internal issues there is avoidance from too high interest rates, authors summon to avoid by using the external issues system and to create the system for external issues alike for internal issues. Consequently, the current system does not provide opportunities to reduce government expenditures, but the improvements summoned by the authors could reduce government expenditures. In parallel to the reduction of coupon payments authors make analyses on the government expenditures on intermediaries. At the end of the research the possible improvements are suggested from the goal of issues, from the process of issues, form coupon payment and intermediaries expenditure perspective.

AB	The concept of fraud, its antecedents and outcomes as well as its detection and prevention, have been discussed by both academics and practitioners for decades. The scope and complexity of the concept of fraud attracts scholars from diverse disciplines.The purpose of our study is to gain a broader understanding of how fraud is viewed in the compendium of academic literature. Using semantic network analysis method, we explore the structure of fraud-related research and analyze the internal connections among the current areas of interest for fraud researchers. We are particularly interested in the relationship between the mainstream financial accounting and audit research and the field of information systems and technology.Our work makes a big stride toward the understanding of current state of fraud -related research. The interdisciplinary semantic map of keywords and subject terms helps understand the trends in fraud scholarship, identify gaps and propose directions for future research.

AB	Current freehand interactions with large displays rely on point & select as the dominant paradigm. However, constant hand movement in air for pointer navigation leads to hand fatigue quickly. We introduce summon & select, a new model for freehand interaction where, instead of navigating to the control, the user summons it into focus and then manipulates it. Summon & select solves the problems of constant pointer navigation, need for precise selection, and out-of-bounds gestures that plague point & select. We describe the design and conduct two studies to evaluate the design and compare it against point & select in a multi-button selection study. The results show that summon & select is significantly faster and has less physical and mental demand than point & select.

Studies and Research, who are eminent social scientists researching the issue of sport. Among them, there are many world-class professors, rectors and deans of excellent universities, founders, presidents and secretaries-general of continental and international scientific societies and editors of high-scoring journals related to social sciences focusing on sport. The journal Physical Culture and Sport. Studies and Research started its activities in 2008 and gathered many readers, distinguished authors and outstanding reviewers. It is worth taking a moment to present the profiles of the individual editors, thanks to whom the journal keeps getting better and better. The journal is increasingly appreciated internationally particular among the scientists from the humanist and social areas of investigations. The rapidly increasing number of its readers and its surprisingly wide reception, indicated by the number of visits and downloads in English-speaking countries, including hundreds of universities (up to 791 were interested in the content of issue 62 of our magazine), research institutes and related libraries, as well as academics, researchers and students, should be celebrated. These data are derived only from one bibliographic data base (EBSCO). It must be noted that the journal is indexed in 43 bases.

AB	A) ObjectivesWe aim to analyze the incidence of a set of variables in business failure, analyzing whether they act in a similar way in conventional capitalist firms and cooperative societies. Specifically, a set of economic and financial variables (profitability, solvency, liquidity, turnover, economic structure, financial structure and activity) and a group of non-financial variables (size, age, industry and region), some of them considered as control variables in previous studies. In addition, the predictive capacity of the model is analyzed in order to identify the variables that allow to anticipate insolvency situations, taking as a reference the economic-financial data of the previous year of entry to the insolvency proceedings. The aforementioned study is carried out for all the companies in the sample, analyzing if there are particularities for the case of cooperative societies. For this, the moderating effect of the cooperative legal form is included, distinguishing between two subsamples of insolvent companies: one formed by cooperative societies and a second one that includes conventional capitalist firms.B) MethodologyA review of the literature on business failure has been made, as well as on the particularities of cooperative societies, especially in economic and financial aspects and their influence on insolvency proceedings. In order to identify the main contributions to the literature and to contextualize the study object, we have used the Web of Science (WOS) and SCOPUS, edited by Elsevier, as well as other databases such as, Dialnet, Academic Search Complete, EconLit, Business Source Complete (EBSCO) and JSTOR-Business. This review allowed us to formulate several hypotheses grouped into three blocks:Those related to the Relationship among Profitability, Solvency and Liquidity.Those linked to Non-Financial Variables (characteristics of the company).Those related to the effect of Other Economic-Financial Ratios on Liquidity.Taking into account these hypotheses, we formulate a model that analyzes the behavior of the companies before the business failure, identifying the same with the condition of insolvent company, being the period analyzed the included between the years 2005 and 2014, both inclusive. The data of the year prior to the entry into bankruptcy proceedings have been taken, including cooperative societies as well as other legal forms. The model uses both financial and non-financial variables, collecting indicators of aspects such as structure or rotation, along with parameters such as age or region.A Structural Equation Model is applied, based on Partial Least Squares, differentiating between external and internal models and statistical significance.C) ResultsThe model has been evaluated according to the reliability criteria (absence of error, showing the accuracy of the measurement instrument), and validity (degree to which an indicator measures what it must measure), at two levels (construct and associated indicators) doing differently according to the relationship were Reflective (Size, Profitability, Activity, Rotation, Economic and Financial Structures), or Formative (Industry, Region and Age).It also examines whether there is a moderating effect of the legal form on the liquidity and solvency of the companies analyzed. For this, a Multi-Group Analysis has been performed, applying the Non-Parametric Approach or PLS MGA. The legal form has been codified as a dichotomous dummy variable, presenting value 1 for cooperative societies and value 0 for non-cooperative societies.Regarding the study of the significance of the hypotheses raised in the model, a procedure of bootstrapping has been implemented for all the companies involved, regardless of their legal form, and for the two differentiated groups (cooperative societies and non-cooperative societies), separating the results related to the hypotheses of the relations between profitability, solvency and liquidity, the hypotheses linked to the control variables and, finally, the hypotheses related to the effect on the liquidity of the other economic-financial variables.From the contrast of the hypotheses put forward in the model for the totality of insolvent companies, the profitability has a positive and significant influence on the Solvency, as well as the Solvency on Liquidity, evidencing a great correlation between the solvency indicators in the short term. On the other hand, the selected Economic Structure indicators would have a small negative effect on Liquidity. Within the non-financial variables are only significant, with a lower level, on the one hand the Age on Solvency and on the other the Industry on Liquidity.If the contrast is performed for each of the subsamples, the results show some differences of the cooperative societies in the hypotheses related to the effects of the non-financial variables on the characteristics for company on Solvency and Liquidity. However, not all of these differences are significant. It is possible to affirm that the legal form moderates only the influence of the effects of the Region and the Age on the Solvency, with a level of significance of 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively, not finding differences in the other variables analyzed.D) Research limitationsWe can highlighted the followings limitations:The lack of a general theory about the behavior of a company that fail. Although it is usual using economic-financial ratios model, the selection of variables is conditioned and specific for the sample on which the research is carried out, so that the predictive capacity of a model is determined by the characteristics of the sample used. Therefore, there are already studies that include other qualitative variables that can increase the predictive capacity of the models.The absence of a consensus on the concept of firm failure, taking as reference in this research the legal criterion, being the most used in most studies, given that it has less arbitrariness. This fact implies a reduction of the size of the sample and, therefore, of the results achieved.The difficulties and limitations of the access to the data of the companies of small dimension, characteristic that underlies in the entities object of this study.The effect of the change in Spanish accounting regulations that occurred in 2008 in the information of the sample companies, as a consequence of the adoption of the International Accounting Standards by the European Union. It should be taken into account that the time horizon contemplated for the sample data used is the period from 2005 to 2014.E) Implications, conclusions and original valueIn view of the results obtained, Profitability, Solvency and Economic Structure anticipate possible situations of business failure. The first two have a positive effect on long-term and short-term solvency, corroborating the hypotheses raised in the bibliography consulted, while the second one would have a negative effect, evidencing that a higher result in these indicators implies a lower weight of current assets, reached lower liquidity.When analyzing the application of the model to cooperative societies, it is verified that the three variables mentioned are valid and significant for this legal form, so the model is also applicable to them. However, there are four differentiating factors: Region, Age, Size and Financial Structure, presenting significant differences only in the first two.

AB	The purpose of this study is to calculate the effect size, by running a meta-analysis, of the experimental studies carried out in Turkey between 2004 and 2014 that investigate the effect of learning styles on academic achievement, attitude, retention, and to define whether the academic achievement shows a significant difference in terms of learning styles model, experimental design and course type. For this purpose, a meta-analytical review method was employed to combine the outcome of the independent experimental studies. The studies included in this review were collected from CoHE National Thesis Archive (2015), ULAKBIM (2015), Google Academic (2015), ERIC (2015) and EBSCO (2015) databases. As a result of the searching process, 402 studies were assessed according to the inclusion criteria and 30 experimental studies were included in this study. Cohen's d coefficient was calculated for the effect size in this study. Because there was a high amount of heterogeneity (Q > x(2), p < .05) among the effect sizes of the studies, the common effect size was calculated according to the random effect model. As a result of meta-analysis, it was determined that the instructional designs based on the learning styles model had a large effect on the academic achievement (d = 1.029), attitude (d = 1.113) and retention (d = 1.290). Moreover, the academic achievement did not show any significant difference according to learning style model, course type and experimental design.

AB	Many school psychology faculty are required to publish for purposes of retention and promotion. It is useful to have an understanding of the different outlets for scholarly publications. In the present study, we investigated the peer-reviewed journals in which school psychology faculty were published between 2010 and 2015, the number of articles in each journal, and the acceptance rates and impact estimates for each journal. We identified school psychology faculty using the National Association of School Psychologists website and conducted a search of the publications using EBSCO databases. Results indicated that there were a total of 3,675 articles and a total of 832 peer-reviewed journals in which school psychology faculty were published during the 6-year span. Among the peer-reviewed journals, Psychology in the Schools, School Psychology Quarterly, School Psychology Review, and Journal of School Psychology were the journals in which school psychology faculty members most frequently published. Acceptance rates ranged from less than 5% to 98%, with an average of 29.7%. H-indexes ranged from 1 to 890, with an average of 52. These results illustrate the variety of journals that publish works from school psychology faculty and the need for school psychology faculty and other authors to consider a variety of options when seeking publication.

AB	With the global reach of the internet and the possibility of interconnection offered by it, fight for a cause also became part of the online universe. This article studies the feminist cyberactivism by analyzing the Facebook page "Feminism without demagoguery - Original". From authors such as Primo, Recuero and Santaella, the study analyzes the interactions established in cyberspace, and new media as protagonists of change in social relations. The work aims to relate the cyberactivism to the reception study on the construction of feminist identity. Through qualitative analysis of comments on posts, it can be observed that the social networking publications are directly related to the formation of identity and enhancement of social relations of its members, who identify with the content. Thus, we can say that the page analyzed operates in cyber activism, because it promotes discussion, relationship and identification of members in their publications.

AB	From June 2013 to January 2015 the Orbis Cascade Alliance (OCA), a consortium of thirty-seven public and private academic institutions, migrated to a new shared Integrated Library System (ILS), Ex Libris' Alma, with Primo as the discovery component. The consortium wanted to cultivate an environment that would better support collaboration and sharing, particularly in the realms of collection development and technical services. This paper examines the immediate impact of the migration on acquisitions workflows, mainly of the largest consortium member, and the short-term and long-term goals following the completed migration. Lessons learned and suggestions for managing a consortial migration are offered, plus a discussion of what it is like to work in the cloud.

AB	This article begins the cycle of portraits of the members of the Editorial Board and Editorial Advisory Board of the journal Physical Culture and Sport. Studies and Research, who are eminent social scientists researching the issue of sport. Among them, there are many world-class professors, rectors and deans of excellent universities, founders, presidents and secretaries-general of continental and international scientific societies and editors of high-scoring journals related to social sciences focusing on sport. The journal Physical Culture and Sport. Studies and Research started its activities in 2008 and gathered many readers, distinguished authors and outstanding reviewers. It is worth taking a moment to present the profiles of the individual editors, thanks to whom the journal keeps getting better and better. The journal is increasingly appreciated internationally particular among the scientists from the humanist and social areas of investigations. The rapidly increasing number of its readers and its surprisingly wide reception, indicated by the number of visits and downloads in English-speaking countries, including hundreds of universities (up to 791 were interested in the content of issue 62 of our magazine), research institutes and related libraries, as well as academics, researchers and students, should be celebrated. These data are derived only from one bibliographic data base (EBSCO). It must be noted that the journal is indexed in 43 bases.Portraits presenting the journal's editors include, among others, their most important professional, organizational and scientific achievements. Each subsequent issue of PCSSR will include one such portrait. We shall begin with the portrait of Professor Jerzy Kosiewicz, Ph.D., who is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal.

AB	Proposes to directly prompt reputed database use over search engines by means of a 3D self-test method and a Linguistic Storm. A 3D self-test schema is used to make users aware of the existing databases within their own libraries pointing to exploit them. The 3D schema consists of three graded axes that involve: a) users 'academic level; b) electronic resources; and, c) linguistic steps to make the IR results pertinent, not repeated (relevant). Additionally, a brief didactic procedure to profit the library's collections is presented. Furthermore, some editors (Proquest, Elsevier and EBSCO) approaches to include their collections references into the popular search engine Google, are discussed. Finally, some remarks on the didactic procedure are included.

AB	Web-scale discovery services such as Summon (Serial Solutions), World-Cat Local (OCLC), EDS (EBSCO), and Primo (Ex Libris) are often touted as a single search solution to connect users to library-owned and - licensed content, improving discoverability and retrieval of resources. Assessing how well these systems achieve this goal can be challenging, however. This article describes the use of interlibrary loan borrowing request data as a means to evaluate whether the Summon discovery system was achieving its goal of improving retrieval. Four years following implementation of the discovery system, there was a 22 percent decrease in interlibrary loan borrowing requests. Requests by undergraduates dropped at a higher rate than faculty, staff, and graduate students. Undergraduate requests for articles dropped more than requests for loans. Two years' postimplementation of the discovery system, the number of interlibrary loan borrowing requests by undergraduates for locally owned or licensed materials dropped by 57 percent, freeing up interlibrary loan staff to expand services into new areas. This study indicates that implementation of a discovery system can lead to a reduction in interlibrary loan borrowing.

AB	Although web-scale discovery services have been implemented increasingly worldwide, there is a need for the exploration of search effectiveness from users' perspectives. In this sense, this study examined web-scale discovery services in the view of users' relevance judgment comparing to individual databases in the fields of Education and Library and Information Science. Using four search topics for the EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS), ERIC, ERC, LISA, and LISTA, their search effectiveness were measured in terms of modified precision, recall, and reciprocal rank based on the relevance judgments of four participants. Comparison of the measurements showed that the web-scale discovery service was less effective than individual databases. In particular, EDS's effectiveness was lower than that of ERIC and ERC in terms of modified precision and recall. The modified reciprocal rank of EDS was lower than those of most individual databases in the fields of Education and LIS. Moreover, the relationship between the rankings from EDS and those from four participants was weak, as indicated by Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients (0.141 in Education and 0.170 in LIS). In fact, the effectiveness in the fields of LIS and Education of EDS was lower than those individual databases to a degree dependent on the field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB	Values education is a learning process that enhances the axiological development of people. From this point of view, the models proposed by Kohlberg (1976) and Molina (2012) provide the basis for planning education programs in values. In the present paper is reviewed historical evolution of the most important in the development of education programs in values theoretical and methodological models. To this end it has carried out a careful review of the relevant scientific literature databases (PsycINFO, Psicodoc, ERIC, EBSCO, Social Services and Abstract Web of Knowledge). The result allows comparisons between different theoretical models and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each of these points, as well as exposure of the main methodological elements involved in values education. Thus, they describe the properties and components of judgment for the selection of the values considering the recipients of educational action.

AB	Discovery systems are now increasingly the dominant technology through which clients discover and access the information resources held by academic and research libraries. However, as yet, little work has been done to explore the use and impact of discovery systems on user behaviour. This article examines transactional logs from the Ex Libris Primo installation of Curtin University Library sampled between 2013 and 2015, together with the results of a user survey conducted in 2014, to investigate actual patterns of use and perceptions of value in the available discovery system functionality. The evidence collected supports the original contention of discovery system designers that the single-search box approach adopted by Google and other internet search engines is an appropriate form for library catalogue design. On the other hand, discovery system users clearly value functionality corresponding to traditional library tasks over attempts to locate the catalogue in the conceptual framework of social media.

Sisikaping palitawin sa ganitong paraan ang maaaring magkakaibang konsepto nila hinggil sa kasaysayan ng Rebolusyong Pilipino.Apolinario Mabini (1864-1903) and Isabelo de los Reyes (1864-1938) (also known as Don Belong) were born on the same year. These two individuals had very different, contrasting personalities, and both of them only reluctantly became involved with the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution of 1896.De los Reyes and Mabini wrote two important texts on their views and experiences of the revolution. De los Reyes' account was published with the full title, La sensacional memoria de Isabelo de los Reyes sobre La Revolucion Filipina de 1896-97 por la cual fue deportado el autor al Castillo de Montjuich [The emotional memoir of Isabelo de los Reyes on the Philippine Revolution of 1896-97 for which the author was deported to the Castle of Montjuich] (De los Reyes, 1899, 2001). This essay will draw mainly upon the first, original section of De los Reyes' memoria written in Bilibid prison and signed by him on the 25th of April 1887 to be presented to Governor and Captain General Don Fernando Primo de Rivera as a collective plea of innocence to the charge of rebellion. (The second part of the complete memorias published in 1899 in Madrid consists of various compiled texts.) De los Reyes' memoria will be compared with Mabini's La Revolucion Filipina (Mabini, 1900, 1931, 2001), this latter work was originally written in the years 1901-1902 in Guam where he had been exiled by the American authorities. Both texts were therefore written under conditions of colonial repression, in prison and in exile.Don Belong's text deals with a shorter period of time than Mabini's which proceeds beyond the Pact of Biak-na-Bato up to the final years of the Philippine revolution.

AB	In the present article we explore the psychological contributions made by the Spanish jurist Eugenio Cuello Calon (1879-1963). He began his career studying the incidence of child crime in Spain. Aware of the problem, during the first decade of the twentieth century he decided to study abroad to learn the psychological methods used to diagnose mental problems in children. Thereby he had the opportunity to work in the laboratory of the French psychologist Henri Pieron. Back in his country, he promoted differential treatment of minors in the legal context through the establishment of juvenile courts. Cuello Calon is clearly a controversial historical figure. His work links to various historical periods in Spain's history (Restauration, Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, Second Republic and the Franco regime) in which such a conservative perspective like his instrumentalized the science of the abnormal child in order to exert a social control over juvenile vagabonds and offenders, who were seen as problematic.

AB	The impact of robots on employment is discussed extensively, for example, within the academic literature and the public domain. Disabled people are known to have problems obtaining employment. The purpose of this study was to analyze how robots were engaged with in relation to the employment situation of disabled people within the academic literature present in the academic databases EBSCO Allan umbrella database that consists of over 70 other databases, Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science and within n = 300 Canadian newspapers present in the Canadian Newsstand Complete ProQuest database. The study focuses in particular on whether the literature covered engaged with the themes of robots impacting (a) disabled people obtaining employment; (b) disabled people losing employment; (c) robots helping so called abled bodied people in their job to help disabled people; or (d) robots as coworkers of disabled people. The study found that robots were rarely mentioned in relation to the employment situation of disabled people. If they were mentioned the focus was on robots enhancing the employability of disabled people or helping so called abled-bodied people working with disabled clients. Not one article could be found that thematized the potential negative impact of robots on the employability situation of disabled people or the relationship of disabled people and robots as co-workers. The finding of the study is problematic given the already negative employability situation disabled people face.

AB	Cholesterol performs a number of important roles in normal brain functioning, including the formation of myelin sheaths and communication between cells, and it has been theorised that statin use could disrupt these roles leading to deficits in cognition. Relevant research was identified via the La Trobe University library Summon (TM) search tool, using search terms including "statin cognition," "statins cognition," " statin brain," " cholesterol cognition," " cholesterol brain," and " statin adverse effects" in addition to examination of the reference lists of the retrieved research articles. Research was examined from the published literature across several different research modalities: systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomised control trials, cohort studies, and case reports. On the basis of the surveyed literature, it is not possible to indicate any consistent caution or limitation with regard to the use of statins and their effects upon cognitive functioning due to the contradictory and inconsistent results arising from this literature. In summary, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether there are either cognitive benefits or detriments associated with the use of the statins. The determination of the effect of these agents on neuropsychological functioning requires more methodologically controlled long-term longitudinal follow-up studies of these treatments due to the complex and multisystem effects of these agents.

AB	Since December, 2015, CAPES has been considering the proposal to open a new course in Professional Master in Business Administration with a focus on Food and Beverage Management. Although this research field (Food and Beverage Management) is already consolidated abroad, in Brazil it is formally unprecedented. This study aimed to identify, through bibliographic research on EBSCO and Food and Beverage Management Commons databases, food and beverage study areas in the field of business administration. This research also aims to identify and quantify the maount of studies by the area. The proposal is to organize the subareas of business administration which framed, longitudinally, research in the food and beverage industry by systematic categorization of the studies. After analyzing title, abstract, keywords, introduction and method of 1138 papers, we obtained a final sample of 368 studies in areas of management in food and beverage. The results have identified 18 areas of business administration in which there is research on food and beverage. The results also have quantified the number of publications and demonstrated, over time, from the 1960s, the progress and turns of the studies on food and beverage in each decade. This paper has contributed to map business areas and provide indicators for scientific production. The study also contributes to point out future research.

AB	The objective of this paper is to raise reflections on the social and environmental issues of the city of Laranjal do Jari from the point of view of its residents who are taking part in this survey. It regards a city located in the frontier area, south of the state of Amapa, that concentrates 94,9% of the county's population, constituted by 39.942 inhabitants. Living in such city means to live with perverse heritages induced by the installation of Jari Project, in the region, in the 70's - a time from which a number of residents live in stilt houses over the waters of the Jari River, whose structure is that of a extended pluvial slum. The city lives with grave social and environmental issues, which, historically, have naturalized themselves to the life of the inhabitants, related to garbage, water, sewage, housing, among others, which ratify the poverty index in the order of 46,2% and are highlights in the urban configuration. The research was of qualitative nature, realized with 48 city residents, field experiments were developed inspired on the Culture Circle, from Paulo Freire. The results indicate that, when it is about proposing changes in the built environment, it is fundamental to summon those who know the reality in which he lives.

AB	Using transaction log analysis of student search histories in EBSCO Discovery Service, which we branded RVOneSearch, we seek to answer: 1. Do students use the limiters provided in RVOneSearch? 2. How effectively do students use keywords in RVOneSearch after receiving instruction on keywording? In Spring 2012, RVOneSearch became an integral part of our 80-minute librarian-led sessions that are required of all English Composition I courses. We began focusing our instruction on selecting appropriate keywords when we noticed that regardless of interface, students struggled most with identifying the right search terms. With RVOneSearch we stopped teaching multiple interfaces and instead began teaching one reference database for background and context, and RVOneSearch for scholarly sources. We spend less time on the nuances of interfaces and more time on evaluating results. We also teach students to use the facets and limiters available in RVOneSearch. In this study we wanted to determine if students used the available facets and limiters and whether they chose appropriate keywords after instruction on how to do so. Our results inform how and what we teach students and are applicable to others teaching with web-scale discovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The goal of this research is to identify how the interactions were mentioned and the improvements that could be applied to them and to the production of future projects in order to contribute to the development of other educational solutions. To perform the research, the methodology adopted was case study with a qualitative approach, based on Yin (2009), Leffa (2006, 2009) and Martins (2008), and the method of content analysis of Bardin (2009). The theoretical framework that guided the analysis were Leffa (2006, 2008), Primo (2001) e Kenski (2008). The categories of interactions by e-mail refer to routine activities of the design phase and adjustments identified after validations production. On the other hand, the categories of interviews refer to perspectives on the face and online interactions, to suggest improvements for the interactions and the process of production and the influence of interactions on the efficiency of the production process. The results shows that face to face interactions provided the clarification of issues related to language that were not understood during online interaction. As a result, it became evident the need to increase the face to face meetings and to promote efficient communication of the online interactions trough exploring new communication tools.

AB	Disruption-tolerant network (DTN) technologies are becoming successful solutions that allow wireless devices carried by soldiers to communicate with each other and access the confidential information or command reliably by exploiting external storage nodes. Disruption-tolerant network (DTN) innovations are getting to be fruitful results that permit remote device conveyed by officers to speak with one another and access the confidential data or secret data or summon dependably by abusing outside capacity nodes or storage nodes. Thus a new methodology is introduced to provide successful communication between each other as well as access the confidential information provided by some major authorities like commander or other superiors. The methodology is called Disruption-Tolerant Network (DTN). This system provides efficient scenario for authorization policies and the policies update for secure data retrieval in most challenging cases. The most promising cryptographic solution is introduced to control the access issues called Cipher text Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE). Some of the most challenging issues in this scenario are the enforcement of authorization policies and the policies update for secure data retrieval. Ciphertext -policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a guaranteeing cryptographic answer for the right to gain entrance control issues. However, the problem of applying CP-ABE in decentralized DTNs introduces several security and privacy challenges with regard to the attribute revocation, key escrow, and coordination of attributes issued from different authorities. In this paper, we propose a secure data retrieval scheme using CP-ABE for decentralized DTNs where multiple key authorities manage their attributes independently.. We demonstrate how to apply the proposed mechanism to safely and proficiently deal with the classified information dispersed in the Interruption or disruption tolerant network.

AB	This paper, first presented at a memorial conference for the Palestinian psychiatrist and activist Eyad el-Sarraj, examines the connection between non-violence and acknowledgement of injuries and trauma in the Israel-Palestine context. It explores the complexity of mutual recognition in a situation of actual oppression, suggesting the counter-intuitive value of the victim's power to humanize the perpetrator. It develops the idea of the third, the witness and the framing opposition 'only one can live' versus 'every life matters,' drawing on Primo Levi's evocation of 'the drowned and the saved' and placing the issue of dignifying suffering alongside recognition of the 'monstrousness' in each subject and in relation to the productivity of the ethos of 'Ubuntu.'

AB	In the aftermath of a consortium migration to a shared cloud-based resource management and discovery system, a small college library implemented a Web usability test to uncover the kinds of difficulties students had with the new interface. Lessons learned from this study led to targeted changes, which simplified aspects of searching, but also enhanced the librarians' ability to teach more effectively. The authors discuss the testing methods, results, and teaching opportunities, both realized and potential, which arose from implementing changes.

AB	Web page views of databases by title and databases by subject pages, in conjunction with COUNTER Database Report 1 and Journal Report 1 statistics, were examined to determine what impact a migration to Primo, a Web-scale discovery layer, had at Central Washington University Brooks Library. The analysis determined that the first year post-migration (2015) compared to the two years pre-migration (2013-14) saw a decline in Web page views of database Web pages, journal full-text article requests, and database record views and result clicks. The implementation of Primo thus had a noticeable negative impact on both direct database access and overall electronic resource usage during the first year post-migration.

AB	Discovery tools are used in libraries to bring together books, articles, and other resources. Research has focused on user and librarian evaluation of these tools, but there are few evaluations of non-book and non-article sources. Discovery tools can also include metadata for local collections harvested through the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). Creating these harvests can be time consuming for staff, so it is important for libraries to understand if and how patrons use these records. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries (UNL Libraries) harvests metadata from local collections into the Encore discovery tool. A study was conducted to analyze patron use of OAI-harvested records. This study analyzed usage data for harvested collections obtained from different discovery sources and referrals through Encore. Google Analytics was used to evaluate searcher behavior differences between content referred through Encore and other referrals. Although discovery through Encore did not result in high numbers of traffic, there is evidence that patrons who discover records through Encore take more time looking through records than patrons using other discovery methods. This increase in time is a measure of engagement and may be reason enough for libraries to consider adding OAI-harvested collections to their discovery tool.

AB	Purpose - Last two decades have seen a marked increase in the interest given to the field of business ethics, particularly, marketing ethics. Marketing ethics provides an innumerable amount of materials and topics for open discussion, as well as for application in practice. Our intention is to open up a space within which to promote timely debate on contemporary marketing education.Design/Methodology/Approach - Monitoring of academic journals in the area of marketing ethics tuition accessible in electronic databases (EBSCO, ProQuest, Web of Science, Google Scholar) by means of the Centre for scientific-technical information SR portal. The work is based on the analysis of thematic categories, and the number of publications and citations. Results are presented in a comprehensive and illustrative manner.Findings and implications - Discussions about marketing ethics and ethical issues are useful. Students need preparation, mentoring and counselling while solving ethical problems, which occur during marketing ethics tuition in the academic field, but also in practice. Academic and scientific sources in the area of marketing ethics education are an excellent "instruction".Limitations - The limitation of this research can be seen in the fact that we focused especially on the marketing aspect of the ethics education. In further research, other fields of interest should be addressed, for example management or practices in commerce, etc.Originality - The aim of the article is to map current trends in research in the field of marketing ethics education, as presented in scientific journals.

AB	The concept "Responsible Research and Innovation" (RRI) has gained ever more importance within the European Union policy. Generally speaking, RRI is an emerging theoretical framework informing a new way to interpret the meaning that research and innovation can have in and for society along with their role in tackling the so-called "grand-challenges of our times". Considered as a more open and inclusive approach to the governance of science, RRI constitutes a challenge for science education. The current study is meant to identify the main conceptual dimensions characterizing RRI as they have emerged in the literature. The literature review was carried out in the EBSCO database. The search term was "responsible research and innovation". The term search was conducted within the full text, and the sources for the review had to be peer reviewed. The articles applied for the analysis had to be published in academic journals. As a result, the sample of the literature review consisted of 35 RRI-related articles. Dimensions in the study have been described so as to understand the potentiality of the concept and to detail the general framework of RRI. Based on the literature review, four dimensions of RRI were identified: inclusion, anticipation, responsiveness and reflexivity. Additionally, two emerging dimensions that were not singled out explicitly as dimensions appeared: sustainability and governance. In conclusion, the six dimensions that were identified in the present study provide a discussion on how RRI can be part of today's educational practices representing a broader meaning that science can have for education.

AB	Introduction: This article examines the knowledge, use, assessment and impact of the social networks Facebook and Twitter and bibliographic databases among the Teaching and Research Staff (TRS) of three Galician universities. Methods: The study is based on a survey conducted among a sample of 463 respondents selected from a universe of 5,498 professors and researchers. The survey has a margin of error of 5% and a confidence level of 95%. Results: 50.2% of the TRS considers that Facebook and Twitter are suitable for teaching and research while the remaining 49.8% thinks otherwise. Scopus and Google Scholar are the most known and used databases, with percentages above 80% and 60%, respectively, while EBSCO and EMBASE are the least known. Discussion and conclusions: There is significant knowledge and use of academic databases, but the opinions regarding the suitability of Facebook and Twitter for teaching and research activities are very divided.

AB	A large number of scientific papers are retrieved using Search Engines from the electronic databases. Some of these Engines are limited and others have designed for a general purpose. A number of researchers wish to prepare a survey of a particular topic. They are facing a problem to find the most related topics to a particular research title. The other problem is rising as a result of a search in an electronic database, where some Search Engines displays Dozens of pages and hundreds of results, it needs also more effort to be scanned manually and decide which results are relevant and which should be excluded. During the search process and matching the contents, the Search Engine maybe ignore some important documents. Some of these documents are excluded although, it is relevant to the subject and some results are included but not important. This research concentrates on a development of a Multi Scanning Filter (MSF) algorithm, that works on research documents found in various scientific databases, such as ISI, SCOPUS or EBSCO, etc. The idea of this research depends on the Google Search Engine, where the proposed algorithm consists of three parts. It maximizes the search space and works as a filter to Google results based on the similarity measure. This algorithm reduces the final search result list, make it more accurate, eliminate the problem of results' dispersion in traditional Search Engines, and helps developers improve current Search Engines, such as Google, this in turn will assist researchers everywhere gather the most related topics to a particular research title in a short time.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to observe how undergraduate students approach open-ended searching for a research assignment, specifically as it affected their use of the discovery interface Primo.Design/methodology/approach - In total, 30 undergraduate students were provided with a sample research assignment and instructed to find resources for it using web tools of their choice, followed by the Primo discovery tool. Students were observed for 30 minutes. A survey was provided at the end to solicit additional feedback. Sources students found were evaluated for relevance and utility.Findings - Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with Primo despite some difficulty navigating through more complicated tasks. Despite their interest in the tool and previous exposure to it, it was usually not the first discovery tool students used when given the research assignment. Students approached the open-ended search environment much like they would with a commercial search engine.Originality/value - This paper focused on an open-ended search environment as opposed to a known- item scenario in order to assess students' preferences for web search tools and how a library discovery layer such as Primo was a part of that situation. Evaluation of the resources students found relevant were also analyzed to determine to what degree the students understood the level of quality they exhibited and from which tool they were obtained.

AB	I describe an effort to cultivate mind and deepen relatedness in patients who exhibit rudimentary thought and constricted forms of object contact, due to the effects of certain neglect or serious disturbance. Some of these patients require the analyst to serve as a catalyst, who takes proactive steps to summon a psychic realm to the patient's experience and to forge components of the dyadic bonds that promote such function. The insights of the object relations tradition into foreclosed development are noted. I argue that such insights can be optimally applied with the benefit of the relational school's emphasis on forms of dyadic engagement and use of the analyst's subjectivity. In some cases of neglect, and others in which serious developmental challenge is the result of disturbance, priority is placed on the patient's growth. Similarly, in my case illustration, my goal in using my subjectivity, as a catalyst, is for my patient to take his own emerging mind and psychic self with interest.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify what managerial implications research related to inter-organizational interfaces has been produced in marketing. For this aim, the authors focus on a specific concept implemented in many firms that operate on business-to-business markets, which is key account management (KAM).Design/methodology/approach - The authors used the Ebsco Database entering "account management" as a key word in the title row. The search provided 51 papers to which the authors added four MSI reports written by Moriarty and Shapiro between 1980 and 1984. The authors then identified such keywords as "managers", "practitioners", "marketers", "managerial", "business", and their variations as well as normative words such as "should", "must", etc. in order to identify managerial implications.Findings - Four main findings are provided: a clear managerial purpose is affirmed by KAM academic works whether as a central "purpose" of the works or as "implications"; these managerial implications may display different forms (dimensions to be considered, consequences to anticipate, advices); though the managerial scope of KAM works is clearly visible, the sophistication of managerial recommendations remains. limited; the identification of who is exactly "the manager" targeted by the implications remains vague.Research limitations/implications - The authors discuss the notion of managerial relevance of academic research.Practical/implications - The authors explore sources for practices (whether they are the ones of scholars or managers) that could help "spelling out more effectively the managerial implications.Originality/value - To the knowledge this is the first work that reviews so precisely how academic articles address to the managerial audience on a precise issue. Furthermore, the authors believe that KAM is an interesting and appropriate field for such a review because it is widely implemented on business markets.

AB	The link between father and child is fundamental, the presence of the former in the birthing room being essential to closer links between the triad. The purpose of this study is to identify the benefits for the father from their involvement during the labor and birth sequence. An integrational review of the literature was carried out together with research on the databases: PubMed, LILACS, SciELO, Institutional Holdings and Digital Libraries and EBSCO Host published between 2000 e 2014. The results demonstrate the existence of a 'new' father who is involved in the consultations during the pregnancy and preparations for the birth, his presence in the birthing room making him feel that he is playing an active part in the process encourages him to develop closer and more intimate links leading to a consolidation of the family unit, the assumption of a parental role in addition to being able to share the experience of the birth with the mother and contribute to her well-being. The team of health professionals has a crucial role in the integration of the father into the process of maternity with his presence also being reflected in the humanization of health care.It may be concluded that there are many benefits from paternal involvement in the birth when accompanying the mother from the moment of pregnancy with an active presence during the birth and enjoying the entire process by sharing emotions and feelings and contributing to the humanization of care and an affective link between the triad.The performance of the Specialist Nursing Staff in the areas of Maternal health and Obstetrics is reflected in the inclusion of the father in the birthing room and in the de-mythification of taboos.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the role of artifacts in the knowledge management field in the past 18 years (1997-2015) and to identify directions for future research.Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 101 articles published in seven journals retrieved from EBSCO and Google Scholar online research databases. The framework for analysis included 13 codes, i.e. author(s), title, year of publication, typology, theoretical lens, categorizations, methods for empirical work, relevancy, level of analysis, keywords, findings, research themes and future research directions. Codes were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods.Findings - The findings lacked cumulativeness and consistency in the current knowledge management debate. Empirical works outnumbered conceptual contributions by two to one, and the majority of papers focused at the organizational level of analysis. Knowledge management systems, knowledge sharing and digital archives were the major research themes connected to artifacts, together with other closely aligned concepts such as learning and online learning, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation.Research limitations/implications - This study has temporal and contextual limitations related to covered time span (18 years) and journals' subscription restrictions.Originality/value - This paper is a first attempt to systematically review the role of artifacts in knowledge management research and therefore it represents a primary reference in the knowledge management field. It provides directions to future theoretical and empirical studies and suggestions to managerial practices.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the databases from a certain library are Pareto-compliant or not? If so, to what extent is the Pareto principle performance evident among these databases? The other purpose is to determine the differences in Pareto principle performance according to time change and database type.Design/methodology/approach - Data on full-text downloads from six e-resources - Elsevier ScienceDirect (SD), Wiley Blackwell, Springer Journal, EBSCO Business Source Premier (BSP), American Chemical Society and American Institute of Physics (AIP) - for the period 2007-2013 were analysed; 42 samples were collected from these databases. The proportion of frequently downloaded journals from databases was selected as an indicator to determine differences in Pareto principle performance according to time change. The difference between the proportion of frequently downloaded journals and the classic proportion of 20 per cent was used as indicator to determine difference in Pareto principle performance related to database type.Findings - There are 33 samples (78.57 per cent) which exhibited the Pareto principle. Four databases Elsevier SD, Wiley Blackwell, EBSCO BSP and AIP - constantly exhibited the Pareto principle. The differences were not significant according to time change. The two multi-discipline databases - Elsevier SD and Wiley Blackwell - fluctuated more moderately than the two single-discipline databases - EBSCO BSP and AIP. Multi-discipline and single-discipline databases showed some differences in Pareto principle performance; however, these differences were not remarkable.Originality/value - The Pareto principle confirmed that there were frequent and infrequent downloads of e-journals from e-journal databases. It was of great importance to analyse these to improve digital resources acquisition and user service.

AB	The construction of thought is inherent in man. However, while teaching mathematics from the use of ICT as soon enable help students develop the ability to think and your creativity. For this it is necessary new definitions, concepts and perspectives on research and education in mathematics and the teaching practice on the use of ICT. This time this paper aims to address the ICT in the teaching of mathematics, in order to think the student nowadays. methodology was used a qualitative approach, bibliographical character from theoretical assumptions (Barros, Castells, Levy, Primo, Silva and others that deal with the theme). The study highlights the importance of ICT and its use in education, particularly through mathematical software, revealing innovate in teaching mathematics including the role of ICT from a new teaching of science, enabling the cognitive development of the student.

AB	The present review aims to determine the main findings concerning positive psychology in older adults. We used the electronic databases Web of Science and EBSCO, which were efficient tools to find the necessary heterogeneity for the selection of studies published between 2005 and 2015, through the following keywords: "Positive Psychology" and "Older". After selecting 12 studies, they were assessed regarding the following information: (a) source; (b) setting; (c) number of older adults (participants); (d) average age (SD); (e) inclusion criteria for each study; (f) instruments; and (g) the results of our investigative question. The results show that interventions with a positive psychology approach are favorable to the reduction of symptoms (anxiety and depression) and the increase of wellbeing; and positive psychology constructs have the same impact on well-being and on reducing symptoms, portraying a promising approach to public health. Our investigation showed the necessity to develop a new perspective on aging. Some of the assessed studies reported that it is possible to achieve this with the inclusion of positive psychology, which can facilitate this development.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a rational and sustainable division of labor between national libraries and the information industry for the preservation of knowledge.Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a based on remarks presented by the author at the 25th Anniversary Conference of the National Repository Library of Finland, held in Kuopio on May 21-22, 2015.Findings - Crafting a useful new role for libraries will require imagination and curatorial rigor, capabilities that the industry has found in the past, and can summon once again. No templates for such a role exist, but must be newly invented by the current generation of librarians. This is a tall order in an era of diminishing public funding for libraries and archives. But it will be essential if libraries are to continue to be key institutions of civil society.Originality/value - There are formidable challenges to ensuring a rational and sustainable division of labor for the preservation of knowledge and many of those challenges will not be solved by new technologies alone. But the discussion needs to move beyond dated, late twentieth century strategies like mass digitization of books and "web archiving".

AB	Objective: To examine the effect of experimental interventions (psychological and exercise-based) on well-being and ill-being related variables in college students.Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Ebsco Academic Search Complete, SportDiscus and Science Direct, including only randomized controlled trials (RCT). Sixteen studies published between 1987 and 2012 (totaling 1342 individuals) met the selection criteria.Results: Both psychological, effect size= 0.48; 95% CI [0.39, 0.56], and exercise interventions, effect size= 0.57; 95% CI [0.42, 0.72] yielded overall positive effects. No differences were found between types of intervention. Results are heterogeneous; moderator analyses did not explain the variability.Conclusion: Psychological and exercise interventions are similarly effective in impacting higher education students' well-being and ill-being. Decreases in anxiety and depression were found after both types of interventions. Only psychological strategies effectively change negative affect. Confirmatory trials and cost-effectiveness studies in college settings are recommended. Future research on strategies combining exercise and psychological approaches is needed.

AB	Purpose - The number of 3D models available on the internet to both students and educators is rapidly expanding. Not only are the 3D model collections of popular websites like Thingiverse. com growing, organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution and NASA have also recently begun to build collections of 3D models and make these openly accessible online. Yet, even with increased interest in 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies, little is known about the overall structure of the 3D models available on the internet. The paper aims to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approach - To initiate this project, a list was built of 33 of the most widely used 3Dmodel websites on the internet. Freely downloadablemodels, as well as models available for purchase or as 3D printed objects were included in the list. Once the list of 33 websites was created, the data for each individual 3D model in the collections was manually assembled and recorded. The titles of the 3D models, keywords, subject headings, license information, and number of views and downloads were recorded, as this information was available. The data were gathered between January and May 2015, and compiled into a CSV database. To determine how online 3D model content relates to a variety of educational disciplines, relevant subject terms for a variety of educational disciples were extracted from the EBSCO database system. With this list of subject terms in hand, the keywords in the CSV database of model information were searched for each of the subject terms, with an automated process using a Perl script.Findings - There have been many teachers, professors, librarians and students who have purchased 3D printers with little or no 3D modelling skills. Without these skills the owners of these 3D printers are entirely reliant on the content created and freely shared by others to make use of their 3D printers. As the data collected for this research paper shows, the vast majority of open 3D model content available online pertains to the professions already well versed in 3D modelling and Computer Aided Design design, such as engineering and architecture.Originality/value - Despite that fact that librarians, teachers and other educators are increasingly using technologies that rely on open 3D model content as educational tools, no research has yet been done to assess the number of 3D models available online and what educational disciplines this content relates to. This paper attempts to fill this gap, providing an overview of the size of this content, the educational disciplines this content relates to and who has so far been responsible for developing this content. This information will be valuable to librarians and teachers currently working with technology such as 3D printers and virtual reality, as well as those considering investing in this technology.

AB	As educators we are haunted. This haunting takes place on several levels, through our personal histories, through key theoretical ideas we have encountered on our journeys, and by those significant educators who have gone before. This paper highlights how Elwyn S. Richardson continues to haunt education in New Zealand. Also how Elwyn, in turn, was haunted by 'Wal' and John Dewey. Rubbing up against neo-liberal reform, philosophers such as Elwyn, give us permission to develop our own personal educational philosophy. Through employing an arts-based autoethnography, we explore how our educational journeys have been haunted by Elwyn. And by drawing on Jacques Derrida's directive, 'speak to the ghost', we summon up Elwyn. To do this we write a series of fictional letters which enable us to reflect on one author's memories. Through analysis of these letters we demonstrate the importance of the Arts as a method to critically reflect upon, and rise above, the dominant neo-liberal ideology we work within. We speculate here that a strong personal philosophy has the potential to disrupt and engage educators critically with an institutional philosophy that continues to dominate much of mainstream education in New Zealand.

AB	In the last three decades, studies involving the areas of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering and that converge on the possibility of mapping and evaluation of the brain in vivo showed significant development, enabling the emergence of the research fields called Neuromarketing and Neuroeconomics. In the present study, existing publications on the topic, with national and international bases were analyzed. Following databases were used as source for research: Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao (ANPAD); Ebscohost Research Databases (EBSCO), Google Scholar, Capes Portal of Periodicals, PubMed (US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health); Scientific Eletronic Library Online (SCIELO), Scientific Periodicals Eletronic Library (SPELL). The predominance of theoretical work reflects a possible difficulty of conducting empirical research, which may be related both to the effective financial cost of the research, as access to integrative search channels, which depend on a transdisciplinary team.

In May 2015, the Libraries released a redesigned interface to improve user experience with the tool. The Libraries took a user-centered approach to redesigning the Primo interface, conducting a "think-aloud" usability test to gather user feedback and identify needed improvements. This article describes the method and findings from the usability study, the changes that were made to the Primo interface as a result, and implications for discovery-system vendor relations and library instruction.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the accumulated body of research on Lean in higher education, draw conclusions to help guide successful Lean implementations and propose future research directions to establish a rich base of knowledge that informs both practice and research.Design/methodology/approach - This literature review examines the academic literature regarding the use of Lean in higher education across 64 publications. EBSCO definitions were used to assess and present the synthesized results, which are detailed at the department/unit level and at the organizational level.Findings - Overall, Lean appears to have significant and measurable value when used to improve academic and administrative operations in higher education. Such improvements are effective at the department/unit level or throughout the entire institution. However, implementing Lean within an institution is a serious undertaking that is most impactful if it involves long-term, strategic planning.Research limitations/implications - The groundwork has been established for the development of conceptual frameworks to further guide Lean initiatives in higher education. Such frameworks, together with further integration of organizational development and change management literature will define best practices when implementing Lean locally and throughout the institution.Originality/value - At the time of this writing, there has been no systematic review or integration of the published literature about Lean in higher education. This review provides a highly useful starting point for researchers interested in further developing theory about quality in academic institutions.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine shifts in the volume and complexity of reference questions received at a small liberal arts college following the implementation of a Web-scale discovery service.Design/methodology/approach - Researchers used the Warner model of reference classification to review and classify reference questions from the academic year prior to the implementation of EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) and the academic year following EDS implementation to evaluate the change in volume of questions and complexity.Findings - Research findings are significant as they document a 34 per cent decline in overall volume of reference activity following the integration of a Web-scale discovery service into the research process. Notably, the question category rated as the highest level of reference complexity (level IV) registered an 18.5 per cent increase in volume, post-EDS implementation. Question levels I-III all saw declines in volume ranging from 45 to 14 per cent.Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the study relate to multiple librarians having recorded questions as they were received by reference services and, as a result, some variation in transaction description should be expected. The concurrent deployment of a Web-scale discovery service and an integrated link resolver made delineation of the respective impact of each tool difficult.Practical implications - Libraries contemplating the integration of a Web-scale discovery service into the research process will be able to use the research analysis to contemplate service redesign in advance of discovery implementation. The research results support additional training of reference personnel to service higher levels of in-depth inquiries. A redesign of reference services incorporating a tiered reference model using proactive chat with referrals to library faculty for in-depth research consultations is recommended.Originality/value - After a literature review of relevant research, the researchers discovered few similar studies. As a result, this analysis will be of significant value to the library profession.

AB	The Brennan Library at Lasell College had not conducted a systematic weeding in over 20 years. With space in demand and an increase in online courses, desperate times called for drastic measures. Over a 10-month period, the library withdrew 40% of its tangible collections. Simultaneously, the staff's focus shifted to promoting e-resources and adopting the EBSCO EDS discovery layer. Using a weighted collection development allocation formula, the librarians overhauled the materials budget and designed a departmental liaison program. After calculating the holdings of new e-book and streaming video packages, the library's collection increased by 50% despite the massive deaccessioning. This paper describes how a small academic library with limited funds and staffing made major changes leading to positive perceptions and avoiding imposing threats. The Brennan Library added seating, zoned areas, and in-demand e-resources for a growing distance-learner population. By changing the collection development emphasis from just-in-case to just-in-time, the library now provides access to more items than ever before. The Brennan Library's example illustrates that an access over ownership model of acquisitions can give similar libraries improved return on investment and positive improvements for stakeholders, provided that significant changes are communicated in a strategic manner emphasizing benefits for the user community.

AB	In bilingual code-switching which involves language-pairs with contrasting head-complement orders (i.e., head-initial vs. head-final), a head may be lexicalized from both languages with its complement sandwiched in the middle. These so-called "portmanteau" sentences (Nishimura, 1985, 1986: Sankoff et al., 1990, etc.) have been attested for decades, but they had never received a systematic, formal analysis in terms of current syntactic theory before a few recent attempts (Hicks, 2010, 2012). Notwithstanding this lack of attention, these structures are in fact highly relevant to theories of linearization and phrase structure. More specifically, they challenge binary-branching (Kayne, 1994, 2004, 2005) as well as the Antisymmetry hypothesis (ibid.). Not explained by current grammatical models of code-switching, including the Equivalence Constraint (Pop lack, 1980), the Matrix Language Frame Model (Myers-Scotton, 1993, 2002, etc.), and the Bilingual Speech Model (Muysken, 2000, 2013), the portmanteau construction indeed looks uncommon or abnormal, defying any systematic account. However, the recurrence of these structures in various datasets and constraints on them do call for an explanation. This paper suggests an account which lies with syntax and also with the psycholinguistics of bilingualism. Assuming that linearization is a process at the Sensori-Motor (SM) interface (Chomsky, 2005, 2013), this paper sees that word order is not fixed in a syntactic tree but it is set in the production process, and much information of word order rests in the processor, for instance, outputting a head before its complement (i.e., head-initial word order) or the reverse (i.e., head-final word order). As for the portmanteau construction, it is the output of bilingual speakers co-activating two sets of head complement orders which summon the phonetic forms of the same word in both languages. Under this proposal, the underlying structure of a portmanteau construction is as simple as an XP in which a head X merges with its complement YP and projects an XP (i.e., X YP -> [xp X YP]).

AB	In this article we examine and review investigations that study the possible presence of depression among patients suffering from bronchial asthma. Throughout the article we provide possible explanations about the relationship between bronchial asthma and depression found in psychological literature along with their possible repercussions in the evolution, morbidity control, and treatment of the illness. Likewise, studies that have investigated depression in families of teenagers and children with bronchial asthma are reviewed. In order to do that, the investigations have been extracted from some of the most widely used databases in Psychology concerning this topic (Web of Knowledge, EBSCO, Psycodoc, Cindoc, Psycarticles and Google Scholar). Finally we offer some reflections about the data analyzed, in the sense that there is enough empirical evidence to confirm that the rates of depression among asthmatic patients and their families are significantly larger than among their asthma-free peers.

AB	Discovery service in libraries has gained momentum in recent years owing to the influence of search giants like Google. Library users are expecting one search solution in similar lines with Google search engine to retrieve information from different sources, viz., library catalogue, bibliographic and full text databases, open access resources, etc. To meet this demand, new age discovery tools such as Summon and Knimbus have emerged and libraries are increasingly subscribing to such services to maximise use of electronic resources. There are also some open source tools, but their deployment is not widely seen in libraries. In this paper an attempt has been made to explain, how Google Custom Search Engine (GCSE) can be used as discovery service for subscribed, un-subscribed and open access resources.

AB	Until recently exergaming was seldom a topic of research. The technology that makes exergaming possible was not available to consumers. In 2006, Nintendo released the Wii gaming system. This new system allowed for interactive physical movement beyond simple hand held play. The Wii system contained hardware and software that responded to movements of the player's body through the tracking of hand held controllers and movements of the lower extremities using floor based hardware. Exergaming appears poised to continue its foray into popular culture for better or worse. After nearly a decade of research a single theory for exergames has not been suggested. Previous researchers have relied on existing theories to guide them. Over a dozen theories have been used by authors of research into exergaming. With all of this research and the many theories that have been used it is time for an examination of these theories as to their relevance for exergaming. This paper endeavors to review the existing literature to identify what theories are being used in research and to delineate what the components of each theory are. A literature review was conducted using the Trident International University online library. This library allowed access to the ProQuest Summon (R) Service search engine which allowed for a search of multiple libraries including Blackwell, Gale, LexisNexis, Academic, Sage, Springer, Emerald, ProQuest, Taylor & Francis, IEEE, and Project Muse resulting in a search of more than 6,800 publishers and 94,000 journal and periodical titles. There are over a dozen theories found in the literature on exergaming. This paper endeavors to examine how often each theory appears in the literature while providing a brief overview of each theory. In the final analysis, the theory chosen for exergame research will be determined by the type of study undertaken.

AB	Therapeutic approaches to health and wellbeing have traditionally assumed that meaningful activity or occupation contributes to health and quality of life. Within social psychology, everyday activities and practices that fill our lives are believed to be shaped by structural and systemic factors and in turn these practices can form the basis of social identities. In occupational therapy these everyday activities are called occupations. Occupations can be understood as a contextually bound synthesis of meaningful doing, being, belonging and becoming that influence health and wellbeing. We contend that an integrative review of occupational therapy and social psychology literature will enhance our ability to understand the relationship between social structures, identity and dimensions of occupation by elucidating how they inform one another, and how taken together they augment our understanding of health and wellbeing This review incorporates theoretical and empirical works purposively sampled from databases within EBSCO including CINAHL, psychINFO, psychArticles, and Web of Science. Search terms included: occupation, therapy, social psychology, occupational science, health, wellbeing, identity, structures and combinations of these terms. In presenting this review, we argue that doing, being and belonging may act as an important link to widely acknowledged relationships between social factors and health and wellbeing, and that interventions targeting individual change may be problematic.

AB	The article contextualizes the use of web services discovery in university libraries, which intend to meet the need of increasingly demanding users when it comes to performance during information seeking and retrieval. The research work aims to contribute to the understanding of these tools, stressing the building of its central index, the structure of faceted search, the relevance criteria used and the presentation of results in a single list. It employed the bibliographical research method for selecting the relevant national and international literature on the subject. It concludes that libraries should revisit the scope of their catalogs to stay connected with the mental models of users and their information needs. Web scale discovery services, integrated with other information services, have the potential to improve the searching experience. These tools should be designed based on users' information seeking behavior and experience to balance their needs and expectations with the capabilities of the system.

The talk focused on principles useful when conducting license negotiations that Hiatt and Jackson discovered through their own experiences as electronic resource management librarians and, in Jackson's case, as an EBSCO representative. These principles cover a variety of concepts, but all seek to frame negotiation as an interpersonal relationship based on mutual need instead of the antagonistic, intimidating process that it can become.

AB	Library websites can be very confusing to users due to their complexity, and part of this complexity is a result of the way we manage and provide access to electronic resources. Libraries use a number of different systems to manage electronic resources, from knowledgebases and OpenURL link resolvers to OPACs and web-scale discovery tools. Unfortunately, this systems-based approach to organizing electronic resources may not align with user expectations when they are doing their research. The growing field of User Experience (UX) design may provide strategies libraries can employ to base the management of electronic resources around user needs and expectations instead of around the systems used to manage them.

AB	Discovery tools are becoming popular all over the world. Yet, there is little information regarding discovery tool implementation and evaluation. The objectives of this study are to explore: (a) librarians' and information professional' current use of discovery tools, (b) to what extent does the TAM explain librarians' and information professionals' intentions to use discovery tools, (c) to what extent do characteristics such as cognitive appraisals explain librarians' and information professionals' intentions to use discovery books, and (d) to what extent do personality dimensions such as openness to experience explain librarians' and information professionals' intentions to use discovery books. The research was conducted in Israel during the first semester of the 2015 academic year and encompassed 145 librarians and information professionals. Researchers used eight questionnaires and two open questions to gather the data. Findings reveal that the implementation of discovery tools in Israel is still in its infancy. Further, findings confirm that the TAM, cognitive appraisals, openness to experience, and importance of discovery tool features, affect respondents' satisfaction with discovery tools.

AB	Jung's idea of the personal equation' amounts to the reflection that theoretical differences between the psychologies that people teach are rooted in their personalities, in other words, that they are due to the psychology each one has'. This concept also applies to different interpretations of Jung's work. The serious difficulties that Mark Saban has with my psychology are a case in point. Recourse to the concept of the personal equation reveals that Saban has his Jung and I have mine. With his insistence on his Talmudic methodological principle of dream interpretation, that the dream is its own interpretation', according to Saban Jung means nothing but a rejection of Freudian free association. My Jung goes far beyond that. Jung understands this methodological principle above all in terms of what he calls circumambulation'. The main part of this paper is devoted to an elucidation of what circumambulation involves as a mode of dream interpretation. The paper concludes with the distinction Jung himself introduced between two types of reading of his work, either as paper' and dead nostrums' or as fire and wind', and pleads for a reconstruction of Jung's psychology as a whole in terms of his most advanced, deepest insights, instead of a dogmatic reading mainly based on the early Jung, a reading for which his later revolutionary insights are at best negligible embellishments.Translations of abstract L'idee que Jung a de << l'equation personnelle >> equivaut a l'idee que les differences theoriques entre les psychologies que les gens enseignent sont enracinees dans leurs personnalites, en d'autres termes, qu'elles ont leur origine dans la psychologie que chacun << a >>. Ce concept s'applique aussi aux differentes interpretations de l'OEuvre de Jung. Les serieuses difficultes que Marc Saban eprouve par rapport a ma psychologie en sont un exemple. Le recours au concept d'equation personnelle montre que Saban a son Jung et moi le mien. Pour Saban, avec sa facon d'insister sur le principe methodologique talmudique d'interpretation des reves selon lequel << le reve est sa propre interpretation >>, Jung ne signifie pas autre chose que le rejet de l'association libre de Freud. Mon Jung va bien au-dela de cela. Jung comprend parfaitement ce principe methodologique sous l'angle de ce qu'il appelle << circumambulation >>. L'essentiel de cet article est consacre a une elucidation de ce que la circumambulation implique dans l'interpretation des reves. La conclusion de l'article se fera avec la distinction que Jung lui-meme a proposee entre deux facons de lire son travail, soit comme << papier >> et << remedes de charlatans >> soit comme << feu et vent >>, et plaide pour une reconsideration de la psychologie de Jung comme un tout en fonction de ses intuitions les plus profondes et les plus avancees, au lieu d'en faire une lecture dogmatique surtout fondee sur les premiers ecrits de Jung, une lecture pour laquelle ses intuitions revolutionnaires tardives sont au mieux des embellissements negligeables.Jungs Idee von der 'personlichen Gleichung' lauft auf die uberlegung hinaus, da ss die theoretischen Unterschiede zwischen den Psychologien, wie sie von den verschiedenen Vertretern unterrichtet werden, in deren Personlichkeiten wurzeln. Mit anderen Worten, da ss sie von der jeweiligen Psychologie abhangen, die der einzelne 'hat'. Dieses Konzept bezieht sich auch auf unterschiedliche Interpretationen von Jungs Werk. Die ernsten Schwierigkeiten, die Marc Saban mit meiner Psychologie hat, sind ein Beispiel dafur. Der Ruckgriff auf das Konzept der personlichen Gleichung zeigt, da ss Saban seinen Jung hat und ich habe meinen. Mit seinem Beharren auf seinem talmudischen methodischen Prinzip der Traumdeutung, da ss 'der Traum seine eigene Interpretation' sei, meint Jung, nach Saban, nichts anderes als eine Ablehnung der Freudschen freien Assoziation. Mein Jung geht weit daruber hinaus. Jung versteht dieses methodologische Prinzip vor allem in Bezug auf das, was er 'Circumambulatio' nennt. Der Hauptteil dieser Arbeit widmet sich einer Erlauterung dessen, was Circumambulatio als eine Form der Traumdeutung beinhaltet. Der Beitrag schlie ss t mit der Unterscheidung, die Jung selbst zwischen zwei Arten der Rezeption seines Werkes eingefuhrt hatte: entweder eine Lesart als 'Papiere' und 'tote Patentrezepte' oder als 'Feuer und Wind' und pladiert fur eine Rekonstruktion der Jungschen Psychologie als Ganzes im Hinblick auf seine fortgeschrittendsten, tiefsten Einsichten, anstatt einer dogmatischen Lekture, vor allem des fruhen Jung, eines Lesestoffes, der fur seine spateren revolutionaren Erkenntnisse bestenfalls eine vernachlassigbare Verzierung darstellt.L'idea di Jung di una equazione personale risale alla riflessione che le differenze teoriche tra le psicologie che le persone insegnano sono radicate nelle loro personalita, in altre parole che queste sono dovute alla psicologia che ciascuno ha. Questo concetto si applica anche alle diverse interpretazioni del lavoro di Jung. Le serie difficolta che Marc Saban ha nei confronti della mia psicologia ne sono un esempio. Il ricorso al concetto dell'equazione personale ci rivela che Saban ha il suo Jung ed io il mio. Secondo Saban, vista la sua insistenza sul principio metodologico Talmudico dell'interpretazione dei sogni, cioe che il sogno e in se stesso interpretazione, secondo Saban Jung non intende dire altro che un rifiuto della libera associazione di Freud. Il mio Jung va ben oltre ci. E' soprattutto nei termini di ci che egli chiama circumambulation che Jung intende questo principio metodologico. La parte principale di questo mio scritto e dedicata ad una chiarificazione di ci che la circumambulation implica in quanto modo di interpretazione del sogno. Questo scritto si conclude con la distinzione che Jung stesso introdusse fra due modalita di lettura del suo lavoro, sia come scritto che come morta panacea, oppure come fuoco e vento e si dichiara per una ricostruzione della psicologia junghiana come un tutto nei termini delle sue intuizioni piU avanzate e piU profonde, invece di una dogmatica lettura basata soprattutto su un primo Jung, una lettura per cui le sue intuizioni rivoluzionare piU tarde sono nel migliore dei casi trascurabili abbellimenti.???? ???a " ???? ????????" ?????? k ???? ??, ?? ????????k? ?a???? ????? ????????k? ?????, ?????a?a???? ?a???? ?????, ????? k???? ? ? ?????. ????? ???a?, ? ???????? ??a????? ????

Este concepto tambien puede aplicarse a las diferentes interpretaciones respecto de la obra de Jung. La seria dificultad que Marc Saban tiene con mi psicologia es un caso puntual. Optar por el concepto de la ecuacion personal nos revela que Saban tiene a su Jung y yo tengo el mio. De acuerdo a Saban, y a su insistencia en su principio metodologico Talmudico de la interpretacion de los suenos, segun el cual el sueno es su propia interpretacion', Jung significa nada mas que un rechazo a la asociacion libre Freudiana. Mi Jung va mas alla de esto. Jung comprende su principio metodologico sobre todo en terminos que el describe como circunvalacion'. La parte principal de este ensayo esta destinada a elucidar que implica la circunvalacion como modo de interpretacion de los suenos. El escrito concluye con la distincion que Jung mismo introdujo entre dos modos de leer su trabajo, como un estudio academico y una medicina muerta, o como fuego y viento. Asi mismo, tambien pide por una reconstruccion de la psicologia de Jung en su totalidad, a partir de los insights mas avanzados y profundos, en lugar de una lectura dogmatica, basada sobre todo en el Jung de los inicios, lectura para la cual sus revolucionarios insights posteriores son, en el mejor de los casos, aditamentos insignificantes.

AB	The paper presents a literary review of several pending issues that show the necessity of an innovation in the field of information management and search systems - still, this innovation must be deep, balanced and scientifically aware of LIS principles. In particular, it examines the role of web-scale discovery services and discovery tools, and their possible inclusion among the library mediation tools.First, the article reviews a number of arguments supporting the development of OPAC interfaces according to the principles of Web 2.0 and semantic Web: extreme user-friendliness and usability, interactive and collaborative organization, interoperability, data granularity. Then, it investigates the prospect of discovery tools as the new 'single' systems to search for all the resources mediated by a library. However, such an innovation should aim not only to the transformation of the query interfaces of databases, but also to the development of a new way of creating and organizing data according to FRBR, RDF, linked data.These arguments are then compared with other approaches more focused on LIS principles. In any case, it is essential to maintain the resources' original coherence, and the authority of the data origin. Finally, the paper remarks the limits of 'information discovery': at present, new systems do not have the same precision of databases, OPACs and other trustworthy tools.(NB: this is the second part of a more extensive study. The first part has been published in AIB studi 1/2015)

AB	Background: Social bookmarking is a social media platform that has in recent years garnered interest as a potential tool in the higher education classroom. Social bookmarking is the process of saving online resources to a centralized location, labeling resources with specific keywords (tagging), and sharing them with other online users. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of social bookmarking, review its use in higher education, and provide a framework for use in pharmacy education.Methods: Search methods included the databases Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), PubMed, Medline EBSCO, Google, and GoogleScholar. Keywords and tags searched included "social bookmarking," "higher education," "pharmacy education," "health professions education," "social media," "collaborative annotation," "Pinterest," "Diigo," and "Delicious."Results: Several articles were found describing the use of social bookmarking in higher education. Evaluations of these uses consisted primarily of student reaction to the use of this new online tool. Several resources available via the World Wide Web described the potential uses for social bookmarking in the classroom, including icebreaker activities, supplemental information related to lecture material, and advocacy.Conclusion: Social bookmarking is an online platform with the potential to engage students in classroom learning. Research is needed to determine if social bookmarking leads to improved learning in pharmacy education. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB	Resource discovery services (RDS), also called web-scale discovery services (WDS), have attracted considerable attention in recent years. This article aims to provide an environmental scan of the adoption of RDS in UK higher education libraries and provide an analysis of RDS resource usage data to gauge whether RDS have an impact on the overall usage of ejournals and ebooks. Findings show that there appears to be a positive impact in most cases, although the extent of this impact varies across libraries and publishers. There is undeniably a degree of complexity in the usage analysis owing to the multidimensional nature of the environment.

AB	Authentic leadership is one of the main theories of leadership which emerged in the last 10 years. It intends to develop more organizations that are authentic with leaders who are self-conscious and relations which are more transparent and ethical. An integrative review of publications on the topic in indexed journals to databases EBSCO, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus and SciELO, from 2000 until the end of 2013 was proposed. Following the stages of search and selection of literature, 136 articles were reviewed. Three main streams of studies on the topic where noted: the first arouse from school management; the second from nursing; and the third from organizational studies. With the advancement of the studies on the topic, the view from organizational management was consolidated, not only in organizational studies, but also in education and nursing. There is a preponderance of theoretical studies on the subject. After the development of the Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ) research was directed more to confirm and validate authentic leadership constructs and instrument rather than to further develop the theory. Thus, it was found that further studies are needed on the subject. The development of more qualitative empirical studies is recommended, including in the Brazilian context, where only two scientific articles addressing directly the issue were found.

AB	This research compiles experimental studies from 1988 to 2010 that examined the influence of the cooperative learning method, as compared with that of traditional methods, on mathematics achievement and on attitudes towards mathematics. The related field was searched using the following key words in Turkish "matematik ve isbirlikli ogrenme, kubasik ogrenme, isbirlikci ogrenme" and in English "cooperative learning and mathematics, meta-analysis." This study covered reports, articles published in refereed journals, and MA and Ph.D. theses. For the international literature review, advanced databases, such as ProQuest Digital Dissertations, EBSCO, and Eric, were mined. A total of 26 studies (n = 36) were considered in the meta-analysis. The effect size for cooperative learning on academic achievement was found to be d(++) = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38 between 0.80) and the effect size for cooperative learning on attitudes towards mathematics was found to be d++ = 0.16. In terms of achievement, the effect size was found to be medium, positive, and significant, but for attitude, it was small, positive, and significant. As a result, cooperative learning was reported to be a more successful method than the traditional method with regard to both achievements and attitudes.

AB	Gastronomy, an important component of tourism, is sometimes the driving force in the destinations. However, there are few studies related to the gastronomic planning in tourist destinations. This paper main objective is to compare the international and the Brazilian scene and identify variables considered by destinations and theirs managers to deploy a tourist gastronomic venture. It's an exploratory research that uses comparative method. The research techniques were the documental and literature review held in the databases of Google Scholar and EBSCO sites. This research took place between August and September 2013, three directly contributed references were validated to the achievement of the objectives. Based on these references a framework was formulated, bringing together the most relevant aspects of the issue, which are creation of image/gastronomic brand; search marketing; type of establishment; visitor profile; zoning; and menus engineering. Finally, we have identified some aspects that were not covered by the references and suggested fostering discussion on the proposed subject. Keywords: Gastronomic tourism. Gastronomy. Gastronomic planning.

AB	Introduction: The purpose of this study was to comprehensively review the best practices and current trends for mentoring programs in academic libraries.Methods: The authors conducted a scoping review of the existing literature on academic library mentoring programs. The following sources were searched to identify relevant studies: ERIC, Education Research Complete (Ebsco) LISA, Library 82 Information Sciences Source (Ebsco), Scopus, the TRIP database, Web of Science and the grey literature.Results: Among 802 unique abstracts, 42 studies reporting on 40 unique programs were selected for inclusion in this review. Of these, 28 programs were specifically designed to facilitate the development of junior or untenured librarians. Common program elements included participant input into mentor/mentee selection, written guidelines, mentor training, and senior administration support. Notably, only 18 authors (42.8%) reported on program evaluation methods and outcomes.Conclusions: Despite the prevalence of the literature that exists on this topic, mentorship programs in academic libraries have been insufficiently explored. Rigorous and ongoing evaluation is required to determine the importance of mentoring programs to the career development of academic librarians, and identify design elements critical to their success.

AB	Over the past two decades, a flood of reflections on major changes have overwhelmed the world of museums. In addition to work on societal trends (Tobelem, 2005; Mairesse, 2011; Hooper-Grennhill, 2000) and their repercussions on the principles of cultural democratization, which affect the behaviour of visitors of all ages (Simon, 2010), it has become imperative for academia to take a critical look at policies behind museology training programs for young professionals in North America and Europe. This article is based on certain trends, such as the convergence of libraries, archives and museums, which contribute to transforming the museum institution and summon new perspectives on knowledge, know-how, and knowing how to be, which young museologists acquire through specialized museology training. The authors suggest that museology programs may need to consider the concept of "knowing how to become" in order to adapt to training that is being called to change over the coming decades.

AB	There is evidence that group cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is an effective treatment, but much of this research has been conducted with outpatient populations. The aim of this review was to determine the utility of group CBTp for inpatients. We systematically searched Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO electronic databases to identify relevant research. We reviewed the resulting articles and included those which had been conducted with inpatients, with symptoms of psychosis, using cognitive behaviour therapy, delivered in a group format. Fourteen articles relating to ten studies were identified. Two were randomized controlled trials; two were cohort studies and the rest were pre-/post-intervention studies. There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies and all had methodological limitations. The findings suggest positive trends towards the reduction of distress associated with psychotic symptoms, increased knowledge of symptoms, decreased affective symptoms and reduced readmissions over several years. However, there is currently not enough evidence to draw any strong conclusions regarding the utility of group CBTp for inpatients due to the small number of studies and limitations in quality and generalizability. Therefore, this review indicates the need for further research, particularly large, methodologically rigorous, randomized controlled trials.

AB	Inquiry-based learning is gaining popularity in science curricula, international research and development projects as well as teaching. One of the underlying reasons is that its success can be significantly improved due to the recent technical developments that allow the inquiry process to be supported by electronic learning environments. Inquiry-based learning is often organized into inquiry phases that together form an inquiry cycle. However, different variations on what is called the inquiry cycle can be found throughout the literature. The current article focuses on identifying and summarizing the core features of inquiry-based learning by means of a systematic literature review and develops a synthesized inquiry cycle that combines the strengths of existing inquiry-based learning frameworks. The review was conducted using the EBSCO host Library; a total of 32 articles describing inquiry phases or whole inquiry cycles were selected based on specific search criteria. An analysis of the articles resulted in the identification of five distinct general inquiry phases: Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion, and Discussion. Some of these phases are divided into sub-phases. In particular, the Conceptualization phase is divided into two (alternative) sub-phases, Questioning and Hypothesis Generation; the Investigation phase is divided into three sub-phases, Exploration or Experimentation leading to Data Interpretation; and the Discussion phase is divided into two sub-phases, Reflection and Communication. No framework bringing together all of these phases and sub-phases was found in the literature. Thus, a synthesized framework was developed to describe an inquiry cycle in which all of these phases and sub-phases would be present. In this framework, inquiry-based learning begins with Orientation and flows through Conceptualization to Investigation, where several cycles are possible. Inquiry-based learning usually ends with the Conclusion phase. The Discussion phase (which includes Communication and Reflection) is potentially present at every point during inquiry-based learning and connects to all the other phases, because it can occur at any time during (discussion in-action) or after inquiry-based learning when looking back (discussion on-action).

AB	Objective - To find out what the effects of a discovery tool are in relation to usage of print and electronic library collections, and with the aim to measure the effects in three specific areas: circulation numbers, use of electronic resources, and interlibrary loan requests.Design - Comparative quantitative analysis of usage statistics and data sets.Setting - A regional comprehensive university in the United States of America.Subjects - Usage data from a university library.Methods - The methods used were informed by three hypotheses stated at the beginning of the study. First, an analysis of usage data of e-resources tested the hypothesis that the introduction of a discovery tool would increase use of e-resources. Second, to test whether the use of print collections increased, circulation statistics including items borrowed via consortia and in-house use statistics were measured. Finally, interlibrary loan statistics from 2010 to 2013 were collated to test if the EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) led to a decrease in interlibrary loan requests.Main Results - The introduction of the EBSCO discovery tool resulted in increased use of EBSCOhost and other databases at the library in question. However, the library's circulation statistics decreased, with a drop of 28% of checkouts compared to the previous year. The drop is more pronounced with undergraduates, who checked out 39% fewer items after the EDS was introduced. There was a 30% decrease in requests for borrowing items from a consortia. There was insufficient data to support or refute the third hypothesis.Conclusion - The implementation of a discovery tool at one library has had both postive and negative outcomes. An increase in the use of electronic collections was observed as a positive outcome, whereas a decrease in the use of print collections was a negative outcome. Due to the findings of the study, the library revised its policy on content inclusion to the EDS. Any new content is now screened for suitability before it is included. As a changing student demographic evolves at the library, with an increase in distance and online learners, the library will grow its collection in line with their needs. The author notes that a further study is needed to examine ebook usage, and recommends that the library consider a move towards ebooks for all collections.

AB	The purpose of this paper is to present the process of designing and developing a dynamic interface for an archaeological management system, with advanced possibilities of viewing, adding and modifying standardized sheets, created at a certain place, based on the coordinates extracted from the map. The main goal of the paper is to present the conception and implementing of the archeological management platform, along with the functionalities behind the composing elements and the classes which help in the process of data manipulation and database connections. This developing process also involved the integration of three modules. The developing process of these modules was based on the Three Layer Architecture and every one of the modules was designed separately. The database is the foundation of this project, because without it the main functionalities of this website wouldn't work. It was developed using the SQL scripting language with the help of the Microsoft SQL Server 2012 development kit. The initial design of its components was based on a standardized model of an analytical sheet of inventory, provided by the Architecture, Restoration and Archaeology Association. This analytical sheet is a standardized version which contains certain characteristic information associated with the archaeological site. The second module which help to the creation of this project is represented by the map, developed with the help of the Google Maps API. The technology provided by Google is highly complex, it offers us a lot of customizable functionalities, extensive documentation and the process of adding new functionalities is possible with the help of JavaScript in a relative simple way. The integration of the map within the interface it's possible with the help of a simple link-based reference, in order to get the needed data from the Google servers. Within this link, we have to summon a key, dynamically created in connection with our specified account. This is called an API key and its usage is that of counting the information traffic. If a certain traffic limit is reached or surpassed it is supposed that the application is not used in personal means and thus certain payroll may apply. In order to use the existing functions or overwrite them, we have to include another link referral to a JavaScript file, where some of the functionalities were already added by a teammate. Completion of this project involved passing through all the stages related to the development of a suitable software product, from its use planning, maintenance and creation of appropriate documentation, involving theoretical knowledge, technology and development. The original contribution of the papers consists in its interdisciplinary nature, given the scope of platform developed, able to provide deepen related information, closely related to the archeology, history and cultural heritage study. The application is in its prototype version and has great potential as a major exploit in the future.

AB	The aim of this research is to analyze the Latin American scientific production on interventions in preventing cognitive decline in older adults. The world population has changed significantly with respect to its age structure, leading to an exponential increase in programs and treatments to prevent deterioration of cognitive functions in the elderly. However, the scientific literature suggests that interventions coexist with dissimilar characteristics and effects in normal aging. A bibliometric study of empirical articles published in spanish-language scientific journals between 2000 and 2014 was performed. The databases consulted were Redalyc, Ebsco, Scielo and Dialnet. The main descriptors used were: "cognition", "daily life activities" and "elderly". The search identified 50 articles. The corpus was analyzed and classified in stages. The treatments used most frequently were: Cognitive Stimulation programs, Memory training programs and Cognitive-Motor Stimulation Programs. Finally, Cognitive-Motor Stimulation Programs, Multimedia Programs and University Programs for Seniors were the most effective in all cases reporting statistical significance in the results. The research on aging covers a wide sector of the publication currently performed in Psychology to be a growing area.

AB	Leadership and followership are very closely associated concepts. However followership, despite leadership, is in current practice overlooked. Similar situation exists in academical sphere where there are countless researches dedicated to leadership, leaders and their characteristics, types, etc. There are only few researches dedicated to followers. This article deals with literature search of academic research and articles dealing with the topic of followership. As there are almost none studies in Czech language, the author uses original English terminology. The sources for literary search were important international institutes (such as Center for Creative Leadership or Rochester Institute of Technology) and chosen databases, specialized journals and citation indexes (such as EBSCO, ebrary Business & Economics, Scopus or Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology).

AB	The present literature review aims to analyze the research published between 2005 and 2015 relative to the relationship between stress and sleep quality, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as an instrument to assess the sleep aspects. This review was conducted in May 2015 based on the electronic databases Web of Science and EBSCO. We used the keywords "sleep quality" and "stress" focusing our target on empirical studies. After reading the collected studies (n=1267), only those who comprised adult samples were selected, resulting in a total of 15 studies. It was found that stress is associated with several individual factors, such as age, employment status, type of work, personality, level of education, and socio-economic status. When considering the use of the PSQI, stress also influenced the quality of sleep as a whole and in its specific components. Depression was considered important in stress relative to the sleep quality. Other relevant variables were the sociodemographic indicators and socioeconomic status. Therefore, it is essential to assess the context of stress and sleet quality so one can establish new explanations for their relationship and functions. In conclusion, it is necessary to develop thorough studies that take into consideration the importance of complementary variables, i.e., psychosocial, sociodemographic, and socioeconomic status, in the context of the quality of sleep. In this way, it will be possible to understand the effects of the quality of sleep in different samples.

AB	Regular exercises can improve walking distance and reduce physical impairment in patients with intermittent claudication. The objective of the research is to summarise and analyse the existing proof about the comparative effectiveness of Nordic walking and traditional walking in the improvement of health indicators in patients with intermittent claudication. Methods: The following online databases were used as sources for data collection: Ebsco, Sience Direct, Clinical Key, ProQuest, Scopus. The selection of works of research was performed on the basis of key words "Nordic walking", "intermittent claudication", "walking with poles", "Nordic walking and walking and intermittent claudication" and the year of publishing (that is, from 2005 till 2015). Inclusion criteria met four works of research that were included in the critical analysis. Results and conclusions: There is no proof about the superiority of the Nordic walking programme over traditional walking (and there exist indications about the superiority of the traditional walking programme) in the improvement of helath indicators, but patients with intermittent claudication feel less discomfort during Nordic walking and they can cover a longer distance by using poles.

AB	It is getting difficult day by day to comply with the sweeping changes in our age. In such an age, it is necessary that teachers being responsible for educating students, follow the developments, overcome the deficiencies and bring contemporary approaches into classrooms. And this could only be achieved via well-structured in-service trainings/professional development programs. Trainings about different topics in different durations are realized for the professional development of the principals, deputy principals, teachers and school staffs by contracted institutions under the heading of "in-service training". Aim of this study is to analyze the in-service trainings being held for elementary and secondary school teachers. For this reason, these questions are searched for an answer: "Which topics are mostly covered in elementary and secondary school teachers' in-service trainings held by MONE?", "In which areas were the teachers' knowledge/skills/attitudes intended to be developed in the last 10-year-period?", "What is the satisfaction level of teachers about these trainings?" In the research, content analysis has been carried out and the trainings are classified under 8 main categories. The research results obtained from the Council of Higher Education Thesis Center and EBSCO, which includes school teachers' opinions about in-service training, introduced that the in-service training quality in Turkey doesn't meet the expectations.

To analyze the place of Kazakhstan, we considered indexes shown in the Global Competitiveness Report. As a result, the most rapidly developing areas of research were revealed (big data, machine learning, 5G, augmented reality, and etc.). The semantic network of the most modern concepts of the ICT domain was constructed that visualizes the binary relationship between the components and their relative importance. By using comparative analysis of the number of publications in the leading countries and some other countries including Kazakhstan, we selected some key domains which need to be seriously improved onto the way of development science in RK.

AB	Collective intelligence is an emerging field that has already had a great impact in many areas and has implications in education, not only from the side of new methodologies but also as a change in the educational paradigm, currently centered on the student and not in the collectivity. [1] Referenced in [2] states "There are many works that address the concept of collective intelligence, and they can be observed in many domains such as education". [3] Maintains that collective intelligence "can be used for both instructors and students to create educational materials that can have great value. The collective intelligence of instructors, teaching assistants, and students can be used for creating and publishing subject area knowledge, instructional materials, instructional methods and tools, educational standards and curricula, assessment materials, student performance assessment and for the evaluation of educational materials."Scientific communication is in fact a discussion forum for the research community and plays a major role in the generation of knowledge and consequently providing progress to society. In this sense, there have been a variety of papers published in diverse scientific journals related to the topic of collective intelligence, and the topic is gaining momentum with the applications of internet technologies which allow a new form for collaboration between individuals.The purpose of this study is to examine the evolution of Collective Intelligence in Education. The research consists of a literature review used to perform a content analysis of publications from electronic search databases. The scientific papers considered are those published between 2010 and 2015 on the subject of collective intelligence. The content analysis is a methodology to analyze the papers that involves comparing, contrasting, and categorizing information using the papers as raw material. The selection of papers was held in: EBSCO, ProQuest, SAGE, Science Direct, ACM, Web of Science, Springer Link and Wiley. The search was limited to articles in journal, full-text, all languages and all sciences. The key term used for the search included collective intelligence in education, the period considered was January 2010 through May 2015. The document search located 586 research papers. The research papers were selected following the approach of [4]. The content analysis strategy implemented to interpret the selected research papers allowed the identification of a group of categories [5].The study found that a significant part of collective intelligence research work was published in high-impact international journals, and it has been used to address many different research questions using a diversity of technologies. The works analyzed show that collective intelligence can strengthen collaboration and competition while enriching interaction between individuals to acquire and share knowledge. In areas such as project based learning, collective intelligence techniques may facilitate decision-making. This collective intelligence literature review is a useful resource for all researchers entering this field and offers a scientific framework that may contribute to the design of future research.

AB	The main objective of this work is to show how the encephalon was presented in the syllabus and Natural Science textbooks published in the first half of the XXth century. For this purpose, it was used a qualitative method based in the Chevallard's concept of didactic transposition. The content of syllabus showed that the study of the encephalon was always associated to the study of nervous system. The neuroanatomical and physiological description of the encephalon on textbooks subdivided in medulla oblongata, cerebellum and brain. The textbooks published in the first two decades of the twentieth century (Aires, 1906, 1920) were more exhaustive in the analysis of these organs than the ones published between 1930 and 1950 (Primo, 1939; Soeiro, 1930, 1950; Lima & Soeiro, 1950). Their analysis showed that the didactic transposition of the scientific knowledge about the encephalon was more based in its anatomy, and less in its physiology, which highlights a bigger advance in the comprehension of its anatomy instead of its function. Every author illustrated the functions of the organs that constitute the encephalon with observation and experiences with animals, like pigeons and frogs.

AB	INTRODUCTION. The objective of this study is to make a general analysis of the educational policies used to teach the Deaf-mute people during the the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930) and during the government of General Berenguer (1930-31) in Spain. METHOD. The methodology used consists on the historical search, the analysis of less-known sources and even unpublished and reviewed of bibliography of the period under study. RESULTS. The central hypothesis is formulated considering the incidence and degree of development that the educational policies of the period of Primo de Rivera and General Berenguer had on the teachings for the deaf that had been reformed by liberal governments; mostly, also for conservatives and for the professional sector in the early twentieth century and more specifically: a) to consider educating the deaf within a full education framework, departing from the charitable care approach, b) to incorporate deaf education in a new stage of special education which was created during those years, c) the use of scientific means to classify and educate the deaf student in special graded educational institutions and d) the establishment of specialized administrative bodies within the organisation, management and implementation of the educational policies of the Ministry of Public Education, national boards for the deaf, blind and abnormal people. DISCUSSION. The results of this paper consider two important ideas, the first is that the policies of the period under study maintained the principles and basic ideas of deaf education found at the beginning of the century. The second is that the development of these policies presented unequal results, positive in the areas of teacher training and the oral development of the deaf student and a continuity in the creation and construction of the school network, ordination and regulation academic of this type of education.

AB	It has been a quarter of a century since 1990, when Cohen and Levinthal first coined the term "Absorptive Capacity" as a firm's ability to acquire, assimilate, and exploit external valuable knowledge and apply it to innovative performance. Since then, the construct has been addressed and developed by a tremendous amount of theoretical and empirical research studies aiming to clarify its capabilities and mechanisms. However, much of the inner capabilities of the Absorptive Capacity construct remain a black box due to a lack of cumulative and cohesive research. To provide clarity to the direction of future research studies in the Absorptive Capacity domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 156 papers retrieved primarily from the EBSCO database. We mainly focused on Absorptive Capacity internal capabilities with regard to the processes of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. The analytic results highlight areas of improvement and provide direction for fruitful future empirical contributions to the Absorptive Capacity construct.

AB	The paper aims to illustrate the research that has led to the creation, design and development of the LI. LO Project (Lingua Italiana e Lingua di Origine), targeted at students of Hispanophone origin of second generation and attending Italian middle school (scuola secondaria di primo grado, aged beteween 11 and 14). The project aims primarily to develop academic skills in both languages and CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) which is the ability to manipulate language and contents for academic purposes. The methodology is divided into two phases: in phase one, before defining the course objectives, data had to be collected on the basis of the linguistic and communicative abilities in both languages (Italian and Spanish) used at school by students of non-Italian origin. Two tools were used: a language test and a linguistic biography. As regards language, mean scores recorded by Italian students were higher than those achieved by Hispanophones. However, for Hispanophone students Italian as a language of study is the language in which their scores were higher. In the second phase a workshop was created with the aim to improve CALP and study-oriented computer skills. A blended methodology was adopted with distance learning delivered through a teaching platform and access to appropriate on-line text books, while traditional classroom teaching took place in a computer lab. The results that emerged in the second phase showed that the LI. LO course helped develop CALP regarding comprehension skills in both languages and in the use of the language, particularly in Italian.

AB	Objectives - To evaluate and compare the results produced by Summon and EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) for the types of searches typically performed by library users at North Carolina State University. Also, to compare the performance of these products to Google Scholar for the same types of searches.Methods - A study was conducted to compare the search performance of two web-scale discovery services: ProQuest's Summon and EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS). The performance of these services was also compared to Google Scholar. A sample of 183 actual user searches, randomly selected from the NCSU Libraries' 2013 Summon search logs, was used for the study. For each query, searches were performed in Summon, EDS, and Google Scholar. The results of known-item searches were compared for retrieval of the known item, and the top ten results of topical searches were compared for the number of relevant results.Results - There was no significant difference in the results between Summon and EDS for either known-item or topical searches. There was also no significant difference between the performance of the two discovery services and Google Scholar for known-item searches. However, Google Scholar outperformed both discovery services for topical searches.Conclusions - There was no significant difference in the relevance of search results between Summon and EDS. Thus, any decision to purchase one of those products over the other should be based upon other considerations (e.g., technical issues, cost, customer service, or user interface).

AB	Purpose - The purpose of the study is to inquire into and to provide an integrated framework of academics' and practitioners' conversations on corporate brand alignment.Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review (with no time restrictions) was used to identify relevant journal publications from the years 2000 to 2013. Based on the retrieved articles, the Hegelian dialectic triad of "thesis, antithesis and synthesis" was used to inquire into conventional thinking on corporate brand management (i.e. through corporate brand alignment).Findings - The final sample of 59 articles brought to light a theory of corporate brand alignment, its recent contradictions and critiques and scholars' attempts to unify them into an integrated framework. Three main perspectives emerged, suggesting that corporate brand could be managed through aligned (i.e. thesis), separated (i.e. antithesis) or mixed approaches (i.e. synthesis).Research limitations/implications - This research considers only English peer-reviewed journal articles retrieved from the EBSCO and WOS databases.Originality/value - This work proposes a contingency approach to corporate brand management, suggesting that there is no single best way of managing a corporate brand: aligned, separated and mixed approaches can be equally successful. Despite the choice of model (which arises from the analysis of the corporate brand meanings, stakeholders and contexts), three transversal corporate brand management imperatives emerged: the delivery of the corporate brand promise, the co-construction of corporate brand meanings and the recognition of the dynamic nature of corporate brands.

AB	Purpose - The Internet of Things or, as John Chambers called it, the Internet of Everything represents the networked connection of people, process, data and things together in order to make connections more relevant and valuable than ever before. In order to understand further this intelligent infrastructure, our contribution aims to investigate the Internet of Things by a revised conceptualization of the topic. The investigation has been carried out on a scientific contribution produced in the last twenty years for economic and corporate purpose, in order to comprehend and manage the new opportunities offered to economic activity from Internet of Things.Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a qualitative approach with the inclusion of a single method approach. In this way, following an analysis of existing literature on the Internet of Things we have applied four keywords (Internet of Thing, Communication Internet, Energy Internet and Logistics Internet) in two databases (Google Scholar and Ebsco) to provide a range of scientific contributions to fill out the literature review. Research is developed according to the study of national and international literature.Originality/value - The Internet of Things will connect everything to everyone in a connected network made up of a Communications Internet, Logistics Internet and Energy Internet in a single integrated system. It has been estimated that in 2020 over 200 billion sensor devices will be connected, creating a market size that in 2025 will be between $2,7 trillion and $3 trillion per year. These devices promise efficiency, social and individual benefits through quantification and monitoring of previously immeasurable qualities. Therefore, the analysis of the literature on Internet of Things, in the time frame between 1995-2015, represents the method to fully appreciate the characteristics, opportunities, possible applications, risks and possible issues linked to the topic.Practical implications - The electronic sensors are now ubiquitous everywhere. The connected sensor-based devices create new types and quantities of high quality information, opening up new opportunities to create services that will provide the society, the environment, the economy and individuals with tangible benefits. Our conceptualization aim to contribute to the identification of the main features, application scenarios and correspondent potential applications of Internet of Things, offering new ideas for further analysis.

AB	Purpose - The importance of culture in contemporary society is steadily increasing; people are paying attention to issues like cultural heritage, values, cultural products and cultural development more and more. Each of these is connected with spiritual, emotional and cognitive knowledge although the studies that have been developed so far neglect the relationship between knowledge management and cultural management. Therefore, we aim to determine the main barriers that appear in the process of knowledge sharing in the cultural organizations from Romania. How is the process of knowledge sharing developed? What barriers interfere? How do the cultural entrepreneurs deal with them?Design/methodology/approach - We propose an exploratory research, based on an ethical and qualitative approach in which we combine the results of a comprehensive literature review with the ones generated by a structured interview. The literature review focuses on the articles published in Scopus, Emerald, EBSCO, ProQuest and Sage databases. The results serve as a starting point in developing an interview guide for the Romanian cultural entrepreneurs who represent our research population. Then, we present interviews conducted with 8 representatives of Romanian public and private cultural organizations (managers, employees and entrepreneurs). We aim to determine how they are sharing their knowledge inside and outside their organization's boundaries and what are the institutional and cultural obstacles that they have to overcome. Data collected are processed using Nvivo software and research techniques like systematization and tabling are applied.Originality/value - This methodology focuses on the main cultural and institutional obstacles which Romanian cultural entrepreneurs have to overcome in order to share their knowledge inside and outside organization's boundaries.Practical implications - The outcomes of the application have both theoretical and practical implications. On one hand, we propose a nexus between knowledge management and cultural organizations. Knowledge creation, sharing and use seem to be ignored by researchers from the field of cultural entrepreneurship. Therefore, by bringing the obstacles that interfere in the process of knowledge sharing from the cultural organizations to the forefront we extend theory from both fields of research: knowledge management and cultural management. On the other hand, we facilitate the development of cultural organizations by monitoring their practices and signalling the challenges they face regarding knowledge management.

AB	While usability tests have been helpful in evaluating the success or failure of implementing discovery layers in the library context, the focus of usability tests has remained on the search interface rather than the discovery process for users. The informal site- and context specific usability tests have offered little to test the rigor of the discovery layers against the user goals, motivations and workflow they have been designed to support. This study proposes hierarchical task analysis (HTA) as an important complementary evaluation method to usability testing of discovery layers. Relevant literature is reviewed for the discovery layers and the HTA method. As no previous application of HTA to the evaluation of discovery layers was found, this paper presents the application of HTA as an expert based and workflow centered (e.g., retrieving a relevant book or a journal article) method to evaluating discovery layers. Purdue University's Primo by Ex Libris was used to map eleven use cases as HTA charts. Nielsen's Goal Composition theory was used as an analytical framework to evaluate the goal charts from two perspectives: a) users' physical interactions (i.e., clicks), and b) user's cognitive steps (i.e., decision points for what to do next). A brief comparison of HTA and usability test findings is offered as a way of conclusion.

AB	Selecting a web-scale discovery service is a large and important undertaking that involves a significant investment of time, staff, and resources. Finding the right match begins with a thorough and carefully planned evaluation process. To be successful, this process should be inclusive, goal-oriented, data-driven, user-centered, and transparent. The following article offers a step-by-step guide for developing a web-scale discovery evaluation plan rooted in these five key principles based on best practices synthesized from the literature as well as the author's own experiences coordinating the evaluation process at Rutgers University. The goal is to offer academic libraries that are considering acquiring a web-scale discovery service a blueprint for planning a structured and comprehensive evaluation process.

AB	Web-scale discovery systems are becoming prevalent in research libraries. Although a number of studies have explored various impacts of discovery systems, few studies exist on user satisfaction. The investigators of this study evaluated user satisfaction with the discovery service Summon at Ryerson University, using online questionnaires and in-person focus groups. Results indicated a high level of satisfaction overall, although this was heavily influenced by the quality of search results over ease of use. The study provides insight into the information-seeking behavior and search preferences of a user when a discovery layer is implemented in a research library.

AB	Despite the prevalence of academic libraries adopting web-scale discovery tools, few studies have quantified their effect on the use of library collections. This study measures the impact that EBSCO Discovery Service has had on use of library resources through circulation statistics, use of electronic resources, and interlibrary loan requests. Additionally, the data were compared against data from similar academic libraries without discovery systems. Findings include a strong growth in e-journal use but a sharp decline in circulation statistics. Implications of discovery on use of the print collection are discussed along with suggestions for improving integration of book and article data.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine whether features of next-generation Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) interfaces are useful and intuitive to users who have different levels of searching ability. In addition, it investigates whether there is a difference between librarians' and students' preferences for specific features.Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on 18 semi-structured interviews conducted in July 2012 with three groups of library users from The University of Sheffield: librarians; Master of Arts Librarianship students; and a group of other post-graduate students.Findings - Overall, this study suggests that while the next-generation catalogue interfaces and features are useful, they are not as "intuitive" as some previous studies have claimed. Interviewees appeared to prefer the searching and browsing options over the Web 2.0 features. Both librarians and students have similar opinions regarding the usefulness of next-generation OPAC features, but preferences are complex.Research limitations/implications - The study is based on one institution, and the disciplinary background of the post-graduate students was limited.Practical implications - Promoting next generation OPACs and explaining their features to users is essential.Originality/value - The paper adds to the understanding of users' preferences in relation to next-generation OPACs, locating the findings of the current findings firmly in the context of previous literature.

AB	Sleep and creativity have been widely studied in the field of psychology, being essential to understand human behavior. However, the relationship between these variables has not been examined through a systematic literature review. The aim of this study was to realize a review of the studies that related sleep and creativity. Thus, we performed a survey of the studies conducted between 1990 and 2014, which were published in journals indexed in the major electronic databases, in particular EBSCO and Web of Science (WoS). We analyzed 1258 papers that respected the search criteria and were selected by combining the keywords "sleep" and "creativity". Of these, 94 articles met the criteria concerning the relationship between sleep aspects and types of creativity or creative thinking. From the abovementioned articles, we picked 11 studies respecting the inclusion criteria. The obtained results indicate a positive relationship between sleep and creativity, nevertheless it was observed a significant variability in terms of sleep constructs and creativity dimensions. Although we can affirm that there is a positive relationship between these constructs, we must recognize the limits of this statement.

AB	The paper presents a literary review of several pending issues that show the necessity of an innovation in the field of information management and search systems - still, this innovation must be deep, balanced and scientifically aware of LIS principles. In particular, it examines the role of web-scale discovery services and discovery tools, and their possible inclusion among the library mediation tools.First, the article reviews a number of arguments supporting the development of OPAC interfaces according to the principles of Web 2.0 and semantic Web: extreme user-friendliness and usability, interactive and collaborative organization, interoperability, data granularity. Then, it investigates the prospect of discovery tools as the new 'single' systems to search for all the resources mediated by a library. However, such an innovation should aim not only to the transformation of the query interfaces of databases, but also to the development of a new way of creating and organizing data according to FRBR, RDF, linked data.These arguments are then compared with other approaches more focused on LIS principles. In any case, it is essential to maintain the resources' original coherence, and the authority of the data origin. Finally, the paper remarks the limits of 'information discovery': at present, new systems do not have the same precision of databases, OPACs and other trustworthy tools.(NB: this is the first part of a more extensive study. The second part will be published in AIB Studi 2/2015)

AB	We present a multi-level model of contextual factors that may influence teachers' assessment practices, and use this model in a selected review of existing literature on teachers' assessment knowledge, views and conceptions with respect to these contextual factors. Adapting Kozma's model, we distinguish three levels of influence on teachers' practices: micro, meso and macro. We searched for relevant articles in EBSCO, JSTOR and other databases, and review selected articles with a focus on the complex relationships within and across these levels. Findings reveal a large body of research at the micro-level (teacher), such as on teachers' values, conceptions and knowledge. However, there is relatively less research at the meso-level (school) or connecting it with the micro-or macro-levels. Implications for future research are also discussed.

In this paper, the transitioning nature of the political, economic, social and educational conditions; the current challenges and trends that may impact NHRD; and the current status of NHRD research in Brazil are examined.Design/methodology/approach - A search of the research literature focused on the political, economic, cultural, social and educational environment and the research associated with NHRD in Brazil was conducted. After searching several databases, including Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, ERIC and EBSCO, several articles were selected and analyzed based on the depth of description of the conditions and research.Findings - Among the factors discovered, race, gender and educational equality are still concerns. The complex nature of the relationship between the Brazilian Government, its people and organizations, as well as the efforts of Brazil's multinational and indigenous organizations to address their national development needs, are also presented.Originality/value - Brazil is currently and projected to be a long-term player in the global economy; however, it struggles to cope with conditions incongruent to the country's long-term success. This paper frames the conditions and suggests ways of moving forward through human resource development practice, policy and research in Brazil.

AB	Innovative learning methods as well as research projects dissemination can be achieved by digital technology. AR (Augmented Reality) can play a key role in the education field in order to transmit knowledge to young generations. AR is used to develop a playing cards game for children based on energy saving topics within the DIMMER (District Information Modelling and Management for Energy Reduction) European Project, where energy consumption awareness is one of its main aims. The DIMMER system enables the integration of BIM (Building Information Modelling), distribution network models, real-time data from sensors and user feedback through QR Codes and web portals. The energy performance of buildings is analysed from their actual utilization and especially from users' feedback. Despite pervasive sensors implementation is a necessary tool to monitor buildings, the more effective way to reach real energy saving is to pursue user awareness and promote good practices in energy using. In fact, energy information sharing has been intended as the main focus in the DIMMER game, since children can adopt good habits that will be reflected on adults behaviour. The game conception has been reached by the collaboration between Politecnico di Torino and Primo Liceo Artistico Statale, as well as the staging of a theatrical show about these issues. In this way a connection between University and High School has been established about current research topics and the uses of new technologies for pedagogical purposes. AR is investigated in order to promote an interactive game for children in which the differences between good and bad practices in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency are discussed. It indeed turns out to be an effective means of communication with immediate impact on children learning. Cards are characterized by markers which are linked to 3D models through a specific software that enables their visualization on personal devices in AR. In the game, natural elements that are capable to generate energy (sun, fire, earth, water and wind) define the seed of every card. Attractive and colourful figures are used to represent renewable energy sources and their applications, while dark images represent the most polluting solutions. The DIMMER game purpose is not to pick up the higher number of cards, but saving energy through positive figures, avoiding those that involve pollution generation. This kind of approach establishes an interaction between children and the energy problem by encouraging active learning through the game and raising their awareness. Children are stimulated by AR multimedia elements that make learning more interesting and entertaining.

AB	In order to assess the use and usability of a new discovery tool, staff at the University of Kansas Libraries conducted usability tests with 27 users and analyzed three semesters of the tool's usage as measured by custom event tracking implemented in Google Analytics and usage statistics drawn from the discovery tool and server logs. An initial study with sixteen users was conducted prior to launching the new tool, and a subsequent study with eleven users was conducted a semester after the launch. This article describes test participants' success using the new tool to complete basic library research tasks, details the specific features they used in their attempts (e.g., facets, "did you mean" suggestions), and identifies areas where changes were made to address problems identified in the studies, including changes outside the tool itself. In addition, comparisons between feature use in the discovery system as observed in usability testing and feature use as measured by event tracking and log analysis are discussed, including implications for the design of future tests.

Mapping the contours of a domain over a period helps in visualizing the changes in the research frontiers of the domain thus indicating the transformations as well as trends in research in the domain. In this paper research literature in information retrieval from IEEE and EBSCO databases were used as data sets to map the contours of the research literature in the area of information retrieval over the last 14 years. The two data sets suggest differing perspectives and emphasis between the two research communities.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the available literature on engagement of faculty members teaching in higher education institutions and present forth a strong foundation for researchers of the same area to gain insight into the available literature and prospects of faculty engagement.Design/methodology/approach - Exploratory study has been conducted using different keywords to draw a list of relevant research papers on Google Scholar and several online databases like Emerald Management, EBSCO Host, Elseiver, etc.Findings - Various definitions of the major constructs have been captured from which dimensions have been explored. Identification of dimensions and factors has been done by performing extensive literature review. Studies so conducted on the major construct have been tabulated to present a comprehensive picture. Universities across the world have been studied to find out differences with respect to India in terms of their higher education system and practices related to faculty.Originality/value - The paper is original and holds significance as not much literature is available on faculty engagement in published domain and higher education has become an area of keen interest in present times. This paper will give a strong foundation of literature to future researchers who want to pursue their studies in this area.

AB	Drawing on our experience with the Primo discovery service at Baruch College, we will discuss the extent to which libraries can expect that they can treat e-book packages in discovery services in the same manner that they treat journal packages. Given that many libraries are still trying to bridge parallel systems for the discovery of e-books-the catalog and the discovery service-this presentation will help organize the problem so that we can develop a deeper understanding of the challenges and outline a map for charting the way ahead.

AB	When the NCSU Libraries initially subscribed to the Summon Discovery Service in 2009, there were few other competitors on the market and none offered an API interface that could be used to populate the "Articles" portion of our QuickSearch application (http://search.lib.ncsu.edu/). Since then, EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) has emerged as a viable competitor. Using a random sample of actual user searches and bootstrap randomization tests (also referred to as permutation tests), the NCSU Libraries's Web-Scale Discovery Product Team conducted a study to compare the search performance of Summon, EDS, and Google Scholar.

AB	The University of Kansas (KU) Libraries first made their discovery tool, Primo (Ex Libris), available to their users in the fall of 2013. Since that time, in spite of many upgrades and improvements, most librarians and library staff are still not using the tool for their own research. Last year, librarians from KU presented their findings at the Charleston Conference using a survey given to KU librarians that asked them to compare Primo to Google Scholar and their favorite databases. Librarians were asked to compare the three and make recommendations for improving Primo. This year, KU librarians designed a much briefer survey and asked all library staff to participate, including student assistants. Library staff were asked to use Primo to conduct research on a topic of their choice and use all aspects of Primo to find relevant results. They were then asked to describe what they used in Primo to lead them to helpful information resources and rank the first 10 results from their final search.The purpose of this survey is to discern how our colleagues use Primo and how successful they are in retrieving the information they need when using this search tool. This study will help KU Libraries develop training for library staff in the use of this new mode of discovery and access. The search terms used in this study will also be useful in helping the discovery implementation team recreate the searches to test Primo in the future, after scheduled upgrades, in order to detect noticeable improvements or problems with the search results.

AB	Many students struggle when citing sources in their research papers and have turned to web-based citation tools in increasing numbers. In order to test the accuracy of the citations generated by these products, a sample of student-selected electronic journal articles was collected and MLA and APA citations for these articles were created using EBSCO Discovery Service's Cite tool, EndNote Basic, RefWorks, and Zotero. Although EndNote Basic, RefWorks and Zotero's APA citation error rates were significantly lower than that of EBSCO Discovery Service, none of the programs was capable of generating an error-free MLA electronic journal citation.

AB	Virtue ethics is generally recognized as one of the three major schools of ethics, but is often waylaid by utilitarianism and deontology in business and management literature. EBSCO and ABI databases were used to look for articles in the Journal of Citation Reports publications between 1980 and 2011 containing the keywords virtue ethics', virtue theory', or virtuousness' in the abstract and business' or management' in the text. The search was refined to draw lists of the most prolific authors, the most cited authors, the most cited articles, and the journals with the most virtue ethics publications. This information allows one to chart how virtue ethics articles have evolved through the decades and to establish schools' or clusters of authors as well as clusters of themes. The results of this quantitative analysis of authors, schools', themes, and publications provide a foundation for the future study of virtue ethics in business and management, identifying its achievements and potentials.

AB	The entrepreneurial orientation is a crucial component of the entrepreneurship and strategic fields. Since the 80s, more researchers are studying the main characteristics of an entrepreneurial firm in different contexts: reflecting risk-taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness (Miller, 1983; Lumpkin et Dess, 1996; Basso et al. 2009). Today, no research was interested to sum up the main works on this subject. This paper provides a bibliometric study of articles over a period of thirteen decades (2001-2013).The bibliometric studies'aim is to understand the evolution of a particular research field and to describe what appears (White and McCain, 1998). The bibliometric studies are based on the mathematical and statistical methods of patterns that appear in the publication (Diodato, 1994, Ramos-Rodriguez and Ruiz-Navarro 2004). Based on this aim, we conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. A total of 312 papers were gathered from the EBSCO data base.

AB	This paper analyzes Knowledge Management (KM) as a political activity, made by the great political leaders of the world. We try to inspect if at the macro political level KM is made, and how. The research is interesting because given that we live in a Knowledge society, in the Information Era, it is more or less obvious that the political leaders should also do KM. However we don't know of any previous study on KM and world leaders and this paper wants to be a first step to fill that gap. As a methodology we use literature review: given this one is a first preliminary study we use data we found in the internet and other databases like EBSCO. We divide the analysis in two main parts: theoretical ideas first, and an application second. The second part is itself divided in two segments: the past and the present times. We find that rather not surprisingly, KM always was and is pervasive in the activity of the world leaders, and has become more and more diverse has power itself became to be more and more disseminated in the world. The study has the limitation of relying on insights and texts and not on interviews. But we believe it is very interesting to make this kind of analysis and such studies may help improving the democracies in the world.

AB	Selection and implementation of a web-scale discovery tool by the Rider University Libraries (RUL) in the 2011-2012 academic year revealed that the endeavor was a complex one. Research into the state of adoption of web-scale discovery tools in North America and the evolution of product effectiveness provided a good starting point. In the following study, we evaluated fourteen major discovery tools (three open source and ten proprietary), benchmarking sixteen criteria recognized as the advanced features of a "next generation catalog." Some of the features have been used in previous research on discovery tools. The purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare all the major discovery tools, and the findings serve to update librarians on the latest developments and user interfaces and to assist them in their adoption of a discovery tool.

AB	This study investigated modulation of gaze and synchronization in piano duos under manipulation of the leader-follower relationship. Three pairs of pianists played under 3 conditions: reversed leader/follower roles and one where neither was leader or follower. The primo and second players could see one another through a glass window but could hear only the sounds of the pianos. We analyzed each performer's gaze toward the coperformer frame by frame and measured asynchrony between performers. The main findings are that (a) gaze was altered in the presence of leadership assignments-followers' and leaders' gaze durations lengthened and shortened, respectively; (b) mutual gaze just before tempo changes enhanced synchronization regardless of leadership condition; and (c) the asynchronies of tone onset at the moment of a tempo change under the leader/follower conditions did not significantly differ from that under the control condition.

AB	There is more to choosing a book than simply keyword searching. Browsing is a fundamental part of the information seeking process, and one that information seekers profess to value, though it has attracted little study. This dearth of research is undoubtedly in part because browsing is nebulous and difficult to quantify. In this paper we use a large circulation dataset from an academic library consortium to examine whether books in the library stacks are loaned in clusters, with a view firstly to confirming the existence of book browsing that has been reported anecdotally, and secondly to quantifying its impact on loan patterns.

AB	E-resource acquisitions began as a complex process and libraries struggled to manage it. When e-resources first arrived, librarians spent considerable time determining how to acquire these resources. A movement ensued to generate the best methods for selecting, ordering, negotiating licenses, choosing content, and paying. Libraries were prompted to develop new workflows. Time has passed and acquisitions functions have mostly been standardized. However, with the acquisition of e-resources comes the challenges of discovery, access, and user needs. Now that many libraries feel more comfortable in acquiring e-resources with the help of technology, cloud-based services, and task coordination, they are moving beyond acquisitions and focusing on discovery and access. It takes much time and great effort to efficiently manage e-resources so that there is seamless discovery and access.The transition from print to electronic is a continuous process for most libraries as they allocate funds for electronic serials and books. Workflows are being developed that incorporate, not only new technology, but also, new staff skills and knowledge. This paper will introduce new workflows and technologies that VCU libraries have adopted to provide discovery and access. A discussion of how workflows have changed since the implementation of Alma and Primo and the influx of e-resources is included. Ideas for identifying successful methods for moving e-resources beyond acquisitions will be shared. Readers will be exposed to a number of ideas for improving the management of e-resources and opportunities that are available for adding value to their library.

AB	The University of Kansas (KU) Libraries first made the discovery tool, Primo (Ex Libris), available to their users in the fall of 2013. Since that time, in spite of many improvements and updates, librarians still prefer to use other resources. In an effort to facilitate open and honest discussion about the Primo discovery tool and to make recommendations to improve the functionality of the instrument, librarians at KU were asked to complete a survey that helped them compare Primo to their favorite database and to Google Scholar. The survey included a known item search, a prescribed topic search, and the opportunity for them to search for a topic in their subject expertise specialty. The librarians were asked the following questions about each resource they used:.Looking at the first ten results, how many of them are relevant?Did you change your search strategy or use the facets in Primo or other methods of narrowing in on a topic to find more relevant results?What was your reaction to the results in each resource?Was it obvious the results included books, articles, or other resources?Were the results easily accessible?In this session, KU librarians will share their survey instrument. They will discuss, in detail, the results of the survey and the comments made by librarians while completing the survey. They will also share the recommendations for improvements they made to IT staff who administer Primo. Audience members will be asked to share their experiences with discovery tools at their libraries.

AB	Building on a presentation given at the 2013 Charleston Conference, this article continues the discussion about acquisitions policies, workflows, and consortial collaboration in a next-generation shared ILS. The Orbis Cascade Alliance is a consortium of 37 public and private academic institutions in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. In January 2013, the Alliance began a two-year process of migrating all 37 institutions (in 4 cohorts, with a new cohort going live every 6 months) to Ex Libris's Alma and Primo in order to realize efficiencies and increase collaboration within the consortium. The authors, who represent institutions in the first and third cohorts, offer perspectives on new consortial structures stemming from changing workflows, policy issues to consider from a consortial viewpoint, challenges and opportunities for the new system, partnering with vendors, and ongoing considerations for large-scale cooperative collection development and assessment.

AB	With discovery systems such as Summon, EDS, and Primo Central, patrons can search nearly all of their libraries' resources from a single platform. In order to create this experience, data from disparate sources must be normalized and unified into one index.In this session, we discussed some of the metadata challenges facing each of the parties involved in library discovery; the library, the publisher, and the discovery system provider. Libraries must normalize their bibliographic records to make them compatible with the discovery system's schema. Publishers need to create mechanisms to regularly export records with meaningful metadata, and the discovery system provider must integrate metadata from these sources while ensuring the best possible user experience.We also touched on the recent guidelines of the NISO Open Discovery Initiative. The guidelines include goals such as "to streamline the process by which information providers, discovery service providers, and librarians work together to better serve libraries and their users." The session will explore how these guidelines can be implemented along with some of the challenges and will include a discussion with the audience.

AB	"Our users are used to searching and don't care for A-Z lists. We don't want to maintain a separate database of databases. Let's catalog the database record once, recycle it and use the discovery API to build a database search feature." Those were our thoughts when introducing our new web site.When filtering on databases Summon API was called and a relevancy ranked list was presented. But immediately voices were raised from researchers and post-graduates that they had difficulties using the tool.So, we decided to build a more traditional database list yet keeping the main principles:To search databases from the general library search box.To maintain in one place only.To retrieve the records through several search services.To build a tool that facilitates discovery and provides additional features we had to use a source with more stringent metadata. Thus we dropped the Summon API and instead used the API from the original source, the national catalog of Sweden, Libris.A team of librarians and IT developers developed a database search feature and list that better met the needs of both students, faculty, and librarians. We, the librarians, got an understanding about APIs. We also learned by painful experiences that to make MARC records at least a bit machine readable we need to catalog with thorough control. The IT developers learned about the MARC reality we still live in.

AB	Background: The implementation of inclusive education creates challenges for classroom teachers who have to meet the learning needs of students with and without special educational needs (SEN). Research has revealed that teachers' readiness and willingness to accommodate the learning needs of students with SEN was determined by their training. Though much research on teacher training and inclusive education has been conducted over two decades, less is known about the adequacy of such training in terms of components and effectiveness.Purpose: The purpose of this review is to present a focused analysis of: (1) studies that examined, in detail, the components of teacher training programmes for preservice or in-service teachers in regular primary schools in terms of content, length, etc., and (2) consideration of the effectiveness of these training programmes.Design and methods: The literature review was restricted to empirical studies published in international peer-reviewed journals after 1994 (i.e. since the Salamanca statement was signed) by using the electronic browser 'EBSCO host Complete'. After applying the keywords 'teacher' and 'educator', they were combined with the following terms: training, disabilities, inclusion, inclusive education, impairment, special educational needs, children with special needs and disorder. The search was deliberately restricted to papers where study participants were preservice or in-service teachers in regular primary schools, and ultimately yielded a small core of 13 studies for detailed review. The first research question was analysed in terms of the training programme's structure and content, covering aspects such as type of disability, topic, length, medium of course delivery and learning activities. For the second research question, the effectiveness of the quantitative studies was evaluated based on the Cohen's d effect size, whereas the qualitative studies were considered as effective based on the calculation of percentage of non-overlapping data (PND).Conclusions: Analysis indicated that the majority of training programmes focused on attitude, knowledge and skills. The training programmes were also centred on what might be considered short-term practice and supplemented with field experiences. Although the training programmes appeared to have positive effects on teachers' attitudes, knowledge and skills, follow-up sessions and students' outcomes measures may increase training effectiveness.

TI	USER PERCEPTION OF THE AFFECT COMPONENT OF THE USABILITY OF PSYCINFO DATABASE

EP	5592

AB	The focus of the present research is on the Affect component of the Usability evaluation of the PsycInfo database. This Usability testing in this research is focused on the User Perception. Oulanov and Pajarillo (2001, 2002, 2003), Oulanov (2008a, 2008b), and El-Halees (2014) emphasize the importance of User Focus, evaluating the Usability of Lexis-Nexis, CUNY+, Business Source Premier, and the Website of the Central Bank of Russia. Shneiderman (1998) postulated that User Focus should be the cornerstone of the Usability research, including the research on Affect. The User Focus succeeded the Systems' Focus that was focusing more on Information Systems and often disregarding the User Perception (Oulanov, 2008b). The recent trends in Usability research suggest that users should be able to use the systems intuitively (Oulanov, 2008b). The system with an advanced state of Usability should be easily perceived and internalized by the user, without exercising any significant effort. The help of an intermediary like a librarian or information specialist should not be necessary. Also, ideally, the user should not be checking the Help file very often. If the user feels comfortable using the system intuitively, then the Affect assessment should reflect this state. Classical Pretest-Posttest Control Group research design was utilized for the present study. Participants were asked to fill out the same survey twice, as a Pretest and Posttest. Before completing the Pretest they were asked to perform some tasks in order to familiarize themselves with the information system. The intervention was introduced in form of the online instructional videos on how to use the database. The Control Group had videos on the subject related to the subject of the tasks, which was a placebo, but seemed to be relevant. As a placebo it did not provide any instructions or training on how to use PsycInfo. The assessment of the Affect as a component of the Usability testing in the present study produced the results similar to the ones present in the earlier research (Oulanov and Pajarillo, 2001, 2002, 2003; Oulanov, 2008a, 2008b). The advantage of the present research included comparison of the User Perception before the intervention in form of the detailed instruction and after this intervention. The previous studies were simpler in their design. They only included cross-sectional one-time Usability analyses. Being more in-depth, the present study demonstrates that the detailed instruction on how to use the database efficiently does not result in users' change of the perception of the system's use over the original intuitive system's use. Therefore, the system is perceived by the user as highly intuitive, and, hence, possesses the superb Usability. The present study brought the Usability Research on the new higher level. While previous research in the field normally did not go beyond one simple cross-section of Usability (Oulanov and Pajarillo 2001, 2002, 2003; Oulanov, 2008a, 2008b), the present study elevated the Usability testing on a new level by assessing the possible differences or absence thereof between User Perception of the information system' intuitive use and by the use resulted from the training, which would give a new perspective on the Usability of the system. This study showed that in case of the PsycInfo, the User Perception of the Usability does not change with the attempted change in the expertise of the user.This indicates that the Usability of PsycInfo on the EBSCO platform is of such a superior level and the system is designed in such a way that it can be used intuitively by a regular user, not requiring any additional investment in the training and developing of any additional expertise.

AB	The paper discusses some current methodological issues related to the field of Information Literacy (IL). It aims firstly at discovering what qualitative procedures have actually been employed in the empirical investigations into various aspects of information literacy in years 2011-2014. Secondly, it seeks to categorize them into research methods, data collection techniques/data sources, analytical frameworks, etc. The paper is descriptive and exploratory in nature. A critical literature review has been the leading method. The EBSCO's specialized database LISTA was searched to find articles reporting empirical research on different dimensions of information literacy. The main observation is that in years 2011-2014, as in the previous periods, the three methodologies (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods) have been used in the IL research. The preferred qualitative data sources were the focus group and individual interviews. As for conceptual frameworks, the information practice or people-in-practice as well as socio-cultural perspectives seem to be growing in importance.

AB	This experimental and descriptive user study intend to focus in particular to improve search skills and encourage usage through certain techniques and tips required to formulate queries and searches to get best results of the information needed from the e-scholarly data bases prescribed by the University of Bahrain Library. A user study with 41 participants was conducted to experiment two e-scholarly database systems from Elsevier and EBSCO (Sciencedirect, Business source complete) as training tools and guidance given to the students' users by the researcher to search particular topics. Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model was used to analyze training session's effectiveness. Two questionnaires are distributed using type of Google application tool (On-line Google form) one pre-lab training session given and the second one post-lab training. It is found that although search results are significantly better through using structured rather than unstructured or simple searching, utilizing more complex searching operators may not worth the effort as it is more likely for users to employ them incorrectly. It is also found that a large number of respondents were using field searching and Boolean operators to access information from e-scholarly databases.

However, the evidence for specific psychosocial interventions are mixed and limited yet. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the relevant literature, to investigate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions focused on improvements in cognition, behavior, mood and quality of life. To select the 10 studies included in the meta-analysis, we conducted an extensive search in the following databases: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EBSCO, WEB OF SCIENCE. The results we obtained show that psychosocial interventions in dementia for cognitive abilities are effective, even if the effect size is low. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB	Sleep and creativity have been widely addressed in the psychology field, given that both are essential to understand human behavior. Nevertheless, the relationships between these constructs have seldom been the subject of systematic research. With this bibliometric study, we aim to analyze published research on the relationship between sleep and creativity. To accomplish this goal, studies published between 1990 and 2013 in indexed journals of the main international databases, particularly EBSCO and Web of Science, were analyzed. A total of 1306 papers that met the search criteria, selected through the keywords "sleep" and "creativity", were evaluated. Of these, 94 articles focused on the relationship between sleep, types of creativity, and creative thinking, were selected. The collected documents were examined descriptively regarding authorship, institutional affiliations, periodicals in which they were published, and more cited descriptors. Amongst the obtained results, it can be emphasized that the United States of America (USA) is the country with the highest number of studies in this area and that the majority of documents (86%) were published from the year 2000 onwards.

AB	Background: Many critical curriculum theorists in physical education have advocated a model- or models-based approach to teaching in the subject. This paper explores the literature base around models-based practice (MBP) and asks if this multi-models approach to curriculum planning has the potential to be the great white hope of pedagogical change or, if in fact, it is a white elephant that should be reconsidered or abandoned.Purpose: To review the literature around pedagogical and curricular change in physical education that relates to teachers experience of models-based practice. This review of research on teachers' perceptions and use of MBP was undertaken in an effort to ascertain the ways in which practitioners' interpreted this type of change in practice.Data collection: Papers were selected by searching EBSCO databases with the identifiers Instructional Models, Sport Education, Teaching Games for Understanding and their hybrids, Cooperative learning, Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility, Personalised System of Instruction Peer Teaching Model and Inquiry Teaching. These were chosen as they match the seven innovative models in Metzler's (2010) compendium of instructional models. Further articles were obtained through the citations and references in the original documents.Data analysis: Analysis of the 45 papers followed a systematic process of inductive analysis and constant comparison. The categories, which emerged from the analysis, were based upon the researcher's perceptions of findings and revealed five key findings/themes; (i) change for teachers, (ii) difficultly and time, (iii) diversification in the teacher's role, (iv) evidence of effectiveness and (iv) university/teacher collaboration.Findings: While changes in attitude, positive feelings, efficacy, enthusiasm and vigour were reported by teachers, there was also an acknowledgement that they lacked experience in using MBP which made them feel like they were beginning teachers' again. For some the conceptual shift was too much and they deliberately returned to their old pedagogies. For others, the change occurred slowly but gradually over the course of the intervention. When professional learning was part of the relationship between the teachers and researchers, then these returns to old practices was not reported. However, it was acknowledged that to engage with MBP required greater effort on behalf of the teacher and that to feel comfortable could take upwards of two years. Change was a difficult undertaking, but when evidence' of success was used to support the teachers' learning then they felt more confident in their decisions. The biggest factor in engendering change was the sustained support offered through collaborative partnerships between schools and universities. These supportive relationships allowed the teachers to continually reconsider their practice with the help of experienced colleagues.Conclusions: While MBP has begun to help practitioners to change and develop their pedagogies and curriculum, we are still a way away from understanding the impact of changing to a models-based approach. Research needs to be focused beyond the initial use of the model(s) and one needs to explore the longitudinal impact of adopting a multi-model curriculum. Furthermore, advocates of MBP need to explore the pedagogical and curricular ramifications on teachers of the long-term adoption of a models-based approach.

AB	The tumultuous changes in the scholarly communications ecosystem have disrupted traditional library assumptions and established new workflows and user expectations. In response, the Auraria Library at the University of Colorado Denver initiated a collaborative design (co-design) initiative to re-invent structures, processes, services, and roles throughout the entire organization. Fostered by appreciative inquiry, enabled by social learning, and furthered by shared leadership, redesign initiated sustainable information exchange, reflective dialog, and knowledge creation practices.The case study highlights accomplishments of technical services staff members who successfully engaged co-workers in selection, implementation, and enhancement of a Web-scale discovery service. Continuing support of the full discovery layer lifecycle illustrates evolving information practices and workplace outcomes at the Auraria Library. Concluding reflections offer transferable insights to other organizations aspiring to co-design workplace environments that enliven creativity, discovery, and exploration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB	In this article we consider the "design for orchestration" concept and introduce a set of notions to clarify matters of concern. We propose to distinguish orchestration technology and orchestrable technology, to define orchestration as a combination of scripting and conducting, and to differentiate primo-scripting and run-time scripting. As a way to see how these different notions relate one to another, we take the example of CSCL scripts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB	In 2011, researchers at Bucknell University and Illinois Wesleyan University compared the search efficacy of Serial Solutions Summon, EBSCO Discovery Service, Google Scholar, and conventional library databases. Using a mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data were gathered on students' usage of these tools. Regardless of the search system, students exhibited a marked inability to effectively evaluate sources and a heavy reliance on default search settings. This article describes these results and makes recommendations for libraries considering these tools.

AB	The purpose of this theoretical study is to provide an updated description of the Social Anxiety Disorder measurement instruments developed for use in child population that have been created in Spanish and / or Portuguese, or adapted and validated for use in these other languages designed for;his purpose and evolutionary stage. Systematic review was carried out (January 2000 - January 2012) in databases: CSIC (ISOC-IME), Dialnet, EBSCO, Journal Citation Reports, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Psicodoc, Pubmed, Redalyc and Theseus. Results show that most Latin American countries have neither translated and designed nor adapted instruments for sociocultural reality. However, those who do, with exceptions, are adaptations usually designed for other English-speaking population. The implications of these and other results are discussed.

AB	Companies look to be ahead in its segment, or remain in the market. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain competitive advantage, going to have to continuously improve their management strategies. One of these is directly related to how innovative production processes are and how well they are managed, resulting in the launch of new portfolio of projects equal or superior to those previously produced. For this, intellectual capital and its knowledge are fundamental and its wastage management is a factor that could be determinant. Scholars sustains that the effective management of people planning must be a part of overall corporate strategy. But, how about the knowledge waste? In this context, the research highlight the problem associated with the performance of intellectual capital, may be impacted, or not by the use of knowledge in part or in whole process, the loss and/or forgetfulness, or use knowledge that does not add value for the company, its customers consequently. This work researched the databases: EBSCO; Emerald; Compendex; Scopus; ISI; and Wiley that occasioned in 506 articles which were systematically analysed, resulting in this theoretical article that presents the main references on the subject and a scientific essay regarding the importance of managing the intellectual capital knowledge waste. We concluded that managing the forms of knowledge waste, it is expected an improvement of performance and competitive advantage.

AB	Boycotting consumer behaviour has been damaging for several business in recent past. This abstract provides a critical review of the boycotting literature from 1900 onward. The review seeks to answer the following questions: What are the gaps and omissions in the boycotting consumer behaviour research? How may they be overcome?To answer these questions, the review scrutinizes blind spots in the treatment of boycotting behavior, role of religious, cultural and political influences in boycotting behavior research in both positivist and critical scholarships. We reviewed systematically 115 academic articles published in 25 top marketing journals ranked in the ABS (Association of Business Journal Schools) Review covered publications from 1990 -2013. Focus was on journals ranked from 1 - 4 and we used the EBSCO and ProQuest search engines using the keyword Boycott as it represent a precise and specific meaning in marketing journals and.The theoretical contribution is threefold: first, the review demonstrates that contemporary framing of boycotting behaviour literature should be expanded to cover aspects of boycotting behaviour beyond its external influences i.e. organisers - promoters- and the boycott target and put the focus once again on individual consumers. Second, the review explains why and how other strands of boycotting behaviour than religion also manifest as salient causes of difference in boycotting consumers. Third, the review reveals that political and religious context has explanatory power in boycotting behaviour. Boycotting literature should capture the intertwining influences of religion, politics and consumer culture. The paper also provides a set of useful recommendations to capture and operationalize methodological and theoretical changes required in the consumer boycotting behaviour literature.

AB	The theory for studying the motivational potential of certain jobs - or job design - was developed for the context of an industrial society, one that is quite different from our current information society. This research proposes a device for discussing and analyzing the key characteristics of motivation referring to jobs, according to the theories of job design and to the information society context. This is a pragmatic research, which applies the Design Science research strategy. Based on an inventory and on content analysis of scientific research concerning job design - published in the twenty-first century in the electronic databases of PROQUEST and EBSCO scientific articles - the motivational characteristics that are associated to this theory were identified, structured and presented in the proposed device.

AB	Religion is a phenomenon evident in every culture. Different types of religion exist depending on the group of believers, the number of gods worshiped and the representations of these gods. However, one commonality the three largest religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism) share is prosociality. They all are based on the notion of sharing, donating and helping others. In some of them, there is actually a prerequisite to support the image of the righteous. The purpose of this study is to investigate if religiosity predicts prosociality through a structured literature review. The key-words used were "religion", "religiousness", "prosociality", "prosocial behaviour", "blood donation" and other words related to these issues. The studies retrieved are dated from 2005 to 2010. The databases used were EBSCO, Sheffield University, PUBMED, and others of psychological and sociological interest. The main hypothesis of the study is that religiosity is positively correlated with prosociality. Secondary hypothesis is that religious priming, both subliminal and direct, will affect religious and, also, non- religious individuals in promoting and enhancing prosocial behaviour. Our conclusions are that (a) religiosity predicts prosociality and (b) priming affects both groups for different reasons. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB	The paper conducts a survey of the state of quality of life measurement on the basis of analysis of overview studies included in EBSCO and Proquest publication data-bases. The analyzed studies were selected according to these criteria: a) authors of overview studies accomplished a systematic research of literature from publication data-bases; b) concept of quality of life was declared by the title or abstract; c) the evaluation of psychometric or clinimetric parameters of measurement was included in the study. From 64 identified studies, 17 were selected for analysis focused on four characteristics of analyzed procedures and instruments: a) what are the theoretical starting points for quality of life measurement, b) how were the evaluated instruments classified into the categories, c) what are their psychometric/clinimetric parameters, and d) what are the recommendations of authors of overview studies concerning quality of life measurement. In theoretical starting points of particular instruments the relative agreement in defining the construct of quality of life was found but big differences in using this construct in measuring, and the confusion of quality of life and health-related quality of life" concepts was identified. Concerning the type of the used instrument the typical differentiation is specific and generic instruments. The specific ones are more sensitive to change and differences between groups but they do not make possible the wider comparison between different categories of respondents. In psychometric parameters of evaluated instruments the absence of verifying the test-retest reliability and non-adequate procedures were found, missing the content and construct validity of the instrument respectively. The responsiveness indicator was the most used clinimetric parameter, its absence was one of often stated deficiencies. Concerning the recommendations of authors of overview studies they are diverse and they alert to numerous problems that must be solved in measuring the quality of life.

AB	Journalistic codes of conduct are regularly mentioned as instrument to secure journalistic quality. But do they really work? To answer this question, we reviewed all academic studies on journalistic codes that are mentioned in the Social Science Citation Index or in EBSCO's Communication & Mass Media Complete database. Our findings show that codes of conduct chiefly perform an - important - symbolic function. Primarily, they address individual journalists. - But because the margin for individual moral decision-making is small, the actual impact of codes depends strongly on the ethical culture of the news desk. That is why we propose, in the final discussion, to focus on ethical guidelines for editorial organizations and the profession.

AB	The research investigated the usability of the "Summon" discovery tool' user interface among External and Internal students' at Charles Darwin University (CDU). Summon is a "Discovery" search tool which supports users in their search for scholarly literature (library catalogs, journal articles, and books). The library at CDU was faced with the challenge of offering users with an easy experience with the tool as a result of increase users' dissatisfaction. Issues and concerns were raised regarding the adequacy and the usability of the tool. The research is conducted in order to find out these issues and in order to provide users with a highly depend tool for finding academic sources. Two experiments based on interviews and questionnaires were conducted on external and internal students using diary studies, heuristic evaluation and usability testing in order to explore the users experience with the tool and in order to identify its usability problems. Data from external and internal users were collected as a set of measureable factors for user interactions. The data collected from the interviews and the questionnaires was analyzed and the poor usability aspects of the tool were identified as well as the reasons of the users' dissatisfactions was identified. The research did not address error prevention and a lack of step-by-step instructions. The findings from the experiments together with a revised interface for the tool where highlighted and the administration of the CDU library were provided with the findings and the recommended changes to the tool. These recommendations were adopted by the CDU library. These recommendations included a revised user interface design for the Summon tool which highlights the necessary changes to be considered. These changes contribute to an easier, clear and user friendly experience which will enhance the user's interaction and user experience.

AB	After the occurrence of Google and failure of federated search engines against Google, web discovery services appeared as a savior for libraries. Main importance of web discovery services is a google-like single search box, speed and comprehensiveness. This study aims an overview for web discovery services and analyzing the use and awareness of these services in Turkey. Web Discovery Services are used by 52 of the Turkish universities, 39 state universities and 13 private universities (August 2012). Ebsco Discovery Service (EDS) and Serial Solutions Summon are most commonly used discovery services in Turkey. EDS have 101 users (31 Universities, 3 Institutions, 1 Military Institution of Higher Education and 66 Ministry of Health Training and Research Hospitals), Summon have 21 users that all are universities. The other two discovery services, OCLC Worldcat Local, Encore Synergy and Primo Central don't have any user in Turkey library market for now. According to the results of the conducted survey (February 2012) to all 160 higher education institutions in Turkey, 63 of the 74 respondents have information about web discovery services. About half of the 39 nonuser institutions attempted for using a discovery service. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main features of the components of Proquest's giga database package for US faculty and students of databases and software services. These allow complimentary access to hundreds of indexing/abstracting, directory and full-text databases, to RefWorks, the most sophisticated reference management program, and to SUMMON, a powerful digital resource discovery program.Design/methodology/approach - This phase of the research focused on evaluating the largest module of GEP which offers 41 databases with more than 200 million records (half of them full-text documents), on the new ProQuest software platform. The paper presents the major content and software features of this module.Findings - The single module, GEP-41, is an important contribution to LIS education, providing free access to LIS faculty and librarians to so many databases covering the US and US-related fields, including the new ProQuest Library and Information Science database with more than 12 million items. The other modules of GEP extend the coverage to databases appropriate to LIS faculty and students interested in various tracks of librarianship. This project certainly will benefit Proquest itself in the long run. From the perspective of the primary beneficiaries, the LIS professors and students, the rich infrastructure for this project offers unprecedented opportunities for a digital renaissance in every aspect of US education and research.Originality/value - This service, highly relevant for US education worldwide, was released in late 2012, and research papers have not been published about it yet. The paper focuses on the measurable, quantitative traits of the largest component of the service.

AB	Emotional Intelligence (EI) provides ability to perform proper 'social functioning' (Mayer and Salovey, 1995). EI is being considered as one of the important competencies to be successful in any field (Goleman, 1995). The purpose of this paper is to establish the use of social media in terms of the users' emotional intelligence competencies and its effects on performances at both educational and organizational level. In doing so, we looked at the collage of articles in the fields of Human Resource Development, Business, Management and Psychology. The study adopted the 'content analysis' approach (Mausner, 1987). Authors performed a thorough research on social media and emotional intelligence that can influence performance and productivity of an individual at workplace. To generate as many relevant publications as possible, we performed manual search and online search through various databases. The databases used included Academic Search Complete (Ebsco), Social Sciences Full Text (Wilson), ProQuest Education Journals, ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis, ProQuest Central, Social Sciences Citation Index (ISI), ERIC (Ebsco), SAGE Full Text Collection (CSA), Google Scholar, Emerald, and SAGE.The results of the study revealed that traits identified in social media articles and critical incidents related to use of social media at K12 and higher education level and the consequences that followed. The selected incidences used in this study affected performance, reputation and productivity. It is noted in the study that 'understanding emotion (own and others)' and 'thinking about the consequences' are some of the common aspects necessary for an individual to be able to avoid social media massacre and help increase efficiency at individual, group, process, and organizational level. It is established that the traits like self-awareness, self-regulation, tolerance, impulse control, empathy and reality testing are related to emotional intelligence. In other words, EI enables an individual to make self-controlled informed decision when selecting content of a message to be posted on social media outlets. The findings of this study show that "words" are lethal and the most powerful weapons that people have and need to use carefully in this attention economy. Words used inappropriately in the social media can spread quickly like a wild fire and cause death, job loss, property destruction even thousands of miles away.There are limited studies that focus on the issue of social media, emotional intelligence competencies and individual productivity. This article has laid pioneering ground work for research on the role of social media in this new attention economy. The paper is limited since it is based on review of literature. Quantitative and qualitative research studies focusing on the relationship between EI and social media efficiency are needed. Empirical studies need to be performed to support the ideas generated in this paper.

TI	STRATEGIES TO SUCCESSFULLY COPE WITH THE REDUCTION OF HOURS OF CLASS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE STUDY PLAN OF AN ENGINEERING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM
SO	7TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2013)

AB	At the Universidad Veracruzana, as in many other public and private universities in Mexico and the rest of the world, the curricula of engineering programs have changed in the last ten years to meet criteria of reduction in academic credits to allow, among other things, to shorten the time needed by undergraduate students to complete their studies. Programs that previously consisted of 450 or more credits, have been reduced to 350 credits or less. All this despite the fact that technological advances impose future engineers the challenge of having to acquire more and more knowledge and to graduate with skills that allow them to be inserted in an increasingly demanding job market. The apparent contradiction has to be resolved, "do more with less", which, in terms of higher education, can be translated to "learn more in less time."Some subjects of engineering programs divide their hours per week in hours-theory and hours-laboratory. This document describes the case of a subject whose hours per week decreased when the educational program in which it is taught was subject to modifications in its Study Plan; the subject changed from 7 hours a week (4 days of one-hour theory sessions and 1 day of a three-hour laboratory session) to 5 hours a week (3 days of one-hour theory sessions and 2 days of one-hour laboratory session). This is a subject that often has groups of 25 to 30 students.With the reduction of the duration of the laboratory sessions, there was not enough time to complete the activities involved in practice sessions; as a result, there were groups that were unable to complete their practices at scheduled times and sometimes the teacher had to summon students to attend additional hours outside the official schedule.In order to improve the performance of its students and after teaching the course several times, the teacher proposed the academy to modify the schedule for the course as follows: 3 days of one-hour theory sessions and 1 day of a two-hours laboratory session. As a result, the activities of the practices sessions were completed as scheduled.The perception of students is that a two-hour practice session allows to make a better use of time than two one-hour sessions. This change in the distribution of hours per week that the students work in their subject, benefits them in their learning process.The authors of this paper suggest that this kind on changes can be applied to the schedules of other subjects which are undergoing similar problems.

This work presents Eye Pull, Eye Push, a novel interaction concept for content transfer between public and personal devices using gaze and touch. We present three techniques that enable this interaction: Eye Cut & Paste, Eye Drag & Drop, and Eye Summon & Cast. We outline and discuss several scenarios in which these techniques can be used. In a user study we found that participants responded well to the visual feedback provided by Eye Drag & Drop during object movement. In contrast, we found that although Eye Summon & Cast significantly improved performance, participants had difficulty coordinating their hands and eyes during interaction.

AB	The University of Illinois Library has been conducting transaction log analyses to model user search behaviors within our Library gateway. These analyses have informed the development and implementation of various search assistance mechanisms designed to facilitate search strategy modification and enhance user search navigation methods. This paper discusses the efforts to effectively overlay search assistance mechanisms into the web-scale discovery system environment. These search assistance mechanisms seek to meet user search needs and to address known issues with web-scale systems. This paper describes an evolving search assistance model being deployed in a web-scale environment and reports our findings from transaction log studies and user surveys.

AB	In September 2011, Flinders University Library launched Findlt@Flinders, the Primo discovery layer search to provide simultaneous results from the Library's collections and subscription databases. This research project was an exploratory case study which aimed to show whether students were finding relevant information for their course learning and research. The Library staff ran usability sessions and an online survey with students. These two methods identified the Primo elements participants were finding useful or not useful, and any problems they encountered. The results of the study provided mostly positive feedback and informed the Library about aspects of Primo that could be modified to create a better user experience. The feedback has also been incorporated into student training plans to ensure the most useful approaches to Findlt@Flinders are communicated to students.

AB	During the last two decades many Hungarian libraries have developed considerably, beyond what was considered possible prior to 1989 and the beginning of events signaling the end of Communism in the country. Some of the modernization of library services has been realized through participation in cooperative agreements. Many smaller and larger consortia have been organized in Hungary since 1991. There are some consortia based around specific vendors, e.g. EBSCO and Pro Quest, but the most important consortia were four state supported programs: FEFA (Orientation towards European Development Fund), OTKA (Hungarian Scientific Research Fund), EISZ (Electronic Information Service), and TAMOP (Social Renewal Operative Program). Through these programs, access to the most important scientific and multidisciplinary databases was provided for the Hungarian academic and research community. They assisted libraries to create a well-functioning Information Technology (IT) infrastructure in addition to a rich collection of electronic sources. What has been achieved so far has been beneficial; however, an extension to the number of accessible databases would be advantageous. This might be possible if more government ministries were involved in the financing of a library consortium based on a national license.

AB	This paper reports the results of a citation analysis of the scholarly literature of LGBT Studies. EBSCO's LGBT Life database was used to gather a sample of 4,321 citations from core scholarly journals in the field of LGBT Studies, covering the time period 1974 to 2010. The analysis reveals that, although LGBT Studies as an area of scholarship emerged from the gay rights activist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the field's literature appears to be firmly rooted in the mainstream academic literature rather than in popular publications or community and activist periodicals. However, the field has a very high rate of cross-disciplinary citation and cites particularly heavily from medical journals and books. In addition to illuminating the citation characteristics of LGBT Studies, this paper presents lists of highly cited books and journals that should prove useful for subject librarians supporting LGBT Studies programs.

AB	This study explored 31 instructional research articles written using video modeling to children with autism and published in peer-reviewed journals. The studies in this research have been reached by searching EBSCO, Academic Search Complete, ERIC and other Anadolu University online search engines and using keywords such as "autism, video modeling, autism spectrum disorders with video modeling and video modeling interventions". It is observed that most of studies have been carried out with children with autism aged between 3 and 11. The studies have been categorized based on their scopes: studies conducted using only video modeling, video modeling studies in which subjects of studies are models, studies in which video modeling and additional practices are used together and studies in which video modeling is compared with other practices. It is observed also that results of studies have indicated that video modeling is effective on teaching social skills, play skills, language and communication skills, functional skills, self-care skills, and daily life skills to children with autism.

AB	From a fledgling technology with no proven business models, electronic books (e-books) have grown in importance usurping traditional formats as an acquisitions budget line in many academic library contexts. Business models include purchase, subscription, and pay per use. In academic and research libraries, web based e-book delivery is the dominant platform involving desktop, Netbook and iPad user agents. E-books are the hot property of today's academic library, forming the new wave in information services along with web scale discovery and institutional repositories.This paper reports the results of a preliminary analysis of transactional e-log data describing academic and student use of Ebook Library (EBL) titles at Edith Cowan University (ECU) Library, Perth, Western Australia. The data mined and analysed encompassing Semesters One and Two of the 2010 academic year. Analysis includes descriptive statistics and other metrics describing e-book usage patterns and user behaviour. The paper compares usage patterns observed with earlier studies and reports on the phenomenon of the 'power user'.

AB	People tend to distort their evaluation of decision-relevant information in favor of the currently preferred alternative. We test whether this predecisional distortion of information is amplified by increased commitment to that current preference. We manipulated commitment, without changing the preferred option's content, by requiring participants to indicate their preference either by circling or by darkening a sizable box (cf. feature-positive effect). Experiment 1 revealed that the effort to darken substantially increased predecisional distortion. Experiment 2 ruled out elaboration as an explanation for the effect of darkening. Experiment 3 showed that, among participants who attributed the darkening effort to an external source, predecisional distortion decreased when the source was believed to summon effort. These findings suggest that the developing commitment to a tentatively preferred alternative is one driver of predecisional distortion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB	To improve resource discovery and retrieval, libraries have implemented new discovery services, such as next generation catalogues, federated search, and Web-scale discovery, in addition to their traditional integrated library systems. These new discovery services greatly improve the user experience by utilizing existing cataloguing records housed within the library system or in combination with metadata from other sources, both in and outside of libraries. However, to maximize the functionality of these discovery services, libraries must reexamine current cataloguing practices and the way libraries control the bibliographic description to better serve the user's needs. This report discusses how new discovery services use the cataloguing records and the challenges that libraries encounter in bibliographic control to work with new discovery services, including the quality of cataloguing records, granular levels of bibliographic description, and integration of user-generated metadata into the cataloguing records. Each of these aspects requires further discussion.

AB	This case study demonstrates how competitive usability testing informs the selection and purchase of a next-generation catalogue (NGC) or Web-scale discovery system (WSDS) to enhance a current library catalogue. Using competitive usability techniques, the authors explain how different NGCs and WSDSs solve issues that catalogue users may face when searching for materials in the online catalogue. The goal of this study is to provide a framework that identifies concrete evidence in support of purchase recommendations for an effective system that adequately addresses locally identified issues with catalogue searches. The process of selecting live system implementations from peer institutions is outlined. Steps include surveying library staff about their current library, catalogue. Survey results and documented reference questions provided the foundation for user tasks created by testers for use in this study. This multifaceted research design resulted in a case study that captures current issues that users encounter in the discovery and access to library materials and shows how to include competitive usability techniques as part of a purchase rationale while assessing how well a variety of next-generation discovery and access systems address users' issues.

AB	One of the presumed advantages of next-generation library catalogue interfaces is that the user experience is improved-that it is both richer and more intuitive. Often the interfaces come with little or no user-facing documentation or imbedded "help" for patrons based on an assumption of ease of use and familiarity of the experience, having followed best practices in use on the Web. While there has been much gray literature (published on library Web sites, etc.) interrogating these implicit claims and contrasting the new interfaces to traditional Web-based catalogues, this article details a consistent and formal comparison of whether users can actually accomplish common library tasks, unassisted, using these interfaces. The author has undertaken a task-based usability test of vendor-provided next-generation catalogue interfaces and Web-scale discovery tools (Encore Synergy, Summon, WorldCat Local, Primo Central, EBSCO Discovery Service). Testing was done with undergraduates across all academic disciplines. The resulting qualitative data, noting any demonstrated trouble using the software as well as feedback or suggested improvements that the users may have about the software, will assist academic libraries in making or validating purchase and subscription decisions for these interfaces as well as help vendors make data-driven decisions about interface and experience enhancements.

AB	This study identified nearly 700 English-language refereed journals in education and psychology that were founded in 2000-2009. Part one discusses the publishers, format, open-access availability, and current status of these publications. Titles were then searched against coverage lists of EBSCO Academic Search Complete, Gale Academic One File, Pro Quest Central, ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DOAJ, Google Scholar, WorldCAT, and the library catalogs of the "Big Ten" universities to determine whether databases and libraries include these new publications. Subscription database coverage was poor, ranging from 8.8 percent (Pro Quest Central) to 42.0 percent (PsycINFO). Psychology materials were heavily favored over education items in several databases. Although some library catalogs provide better title-level coverage, they are unable to search individual articles. Google Scholar only indexed the publishers' versions of the journals in 143 (58.0%) of 247 cases examined. Significant differences in database coverage and library holdings were found when comparing publications of major corporations (Elsevier, Routledge/Taylor & Francis, Sage, Springer, and Wiley) against periodicals produced by smaller companies, colleges/universities, and scholarly/professional organizations. This article also describes a "ubiquity index" devised by the author to identify approximately 70 "journals of the decade" based on database coverage and library holdings. The study provides much cause for concern about the comprehensiveness and currency of existing discovery tools. It also offers evidence that the relationship between libraries and publishing conglomerates deserves further examination.

AB	Eduardo Primo Yufera was the founder of the Institute of Agrochemicals and Food Technology (IATA-CSIC) and was its director until being appointed president of the Spanish National Research Council. He is considered both patron and promoter of the fields of food science and technology and chemical ecology in Spain, as well as pioneer of the innovation system model (R+D+i). Throughout his long research career; which lasted 65 years, he published 291 scientific papers, with an average of 4.48 papers per year Of these, 89.3% were in collaboration with others: a total of 161 different coauthors. His efforts to disseminate science led him to create the Revista de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos in 1961. A total of 50% of his scientific production was featured in this journal but his work was also published in more than 50 national and international scientific journals, of which 36 are included in the journal Citation Report. Those with the highest impact factors are journal of Organic Chemistry, Planta and Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, which feature in the first quartile in their respective subject areas. The 86 articles listed in SCI-Expanded have received a total of 482 citations. This study highlights his scientific activity, using bibliometric indicators of productivity, collaboration and the scientific impact of his publications.

AB	Negotiation is one of the important skills required in workplace situations. It needs a highly complex set of knowledge and skills in order to bring a firm grasp of the subject under discussion. For a successful negotiation, an individual should possess good command of the language and communication skills. However, students fail to use the appropriate language expressions in "negotiation" simulation. Therefore, this study attempts to help students in carrying out "negotiation" simulation effectively by utilizing teacher's feedback as an input strategy. Recent survey has shown that negotiation can be carried out based on experiential learning and simulations as a teaching tool. Feedback is a powerful tool for learning as it often challenges students' way of expressing ideas and way of thinking. This paper aims to present review of literature related to the inquiry. A review of the literature was conducted using Sciencedirect, EBSCO, Taylor, Open Acess, Cambridge and other related databases. The findings will give insights on how to use feedback as a tool to help students in using the right language expressions which will enable them to perform effectively in "negotiation" simulation. It is hoped that this study will also assist teachers in providing constructive and meaningful feedback to students. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB	Purpose - Considering a lack of database designers attention to the features of user information seeking behavior in designating user-interfaces, the aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which user interface characteristics of some main databases (Ebsco, Emerald, Proquest and Science Direct) are in accordance with Ellis' model of information seeking behavior.Design/Method/Approach - Using a heuristic evaluation method frequently used in human-computer interaction research, the necessary information was collected by direct observation of these databases' user interface against a checklist containing six features of Ellis' model.Findings - Interface designers have rarely applied these features in the design and structure of the studied user interfaces. Some features of Ellis' model, i.e., starting, chaining and differentiating were relatively found in these interfaces. However, other three features of this model, namely browsing, monitoring and extracting were not supported by the interfaces. The degree of match between these user interfaces with Ellis' model is at average.Originality/value - Taking information seeking behavior into account when designing user interfaces will improve them and help users in accessing more relevant information with ease and speed.

AB	Despite growing interest in corporate discourse practices, linguists have rarely focused specifically on the discursive legitimation of institutional or corporate actors after perceived episodes of wrongdoing. This may be due to the fact that under normal conditions, legitimation may scarcely be perceptible, only reaching a significant pitch when a major crisis threatens the existence of the agents involved. Should such an event occur, then institutions will summon up a range of justificatory discursive strategies embodying ideological elements that will resonate with socially accepted ideas, feelings or desires. One case in which legitimation could clearly be perceived was that of the oil industry after the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. In the wake of the disaster, as the oil spread and the crisis appeared to be uncontrollable, public opinion turned against the oil industry. It comes as no surprise that the messages to shareholders published in the annual reports of oil corporations during the following year all make reference to the incident and attempt to legitimate both the individual companies and the sector as a whole, in the eyes of the public in general and the shareholders for whom the reports are intended. This article examines the discourses of legitimation used in these texts, focusing specifically on the roles assumed by the writer as scientist and environmentalist, as well as financial expert, and on the storytelling techniques used to present the events as a survivor narrative. It discusses ways in which these writers endeavour to engage readers' solidarity, while also appealing to their interests as stakeholders. These discourses operate on an ideological level to underpin the workings of large corporations within the complex panorama of contemporary capitalism.

AB	Web-scale discovery services for libraries provide deep discovery to a library's local and licensed content and represent an evolution-perhaps a revolution-for end-user information discovery as pertains to library collections. This article frames the topic of web-scale discovery and begins by illuminating web-scale discovery from an academic library's perspective-that is, the internal perspective seeking widespread staff participation in the discovery conversation. This included the creation of the Discovery Task Force, a group that educated library staff, conducted internal staff surveys, and gathered observations from early adopters. The article next addresses the substantial research conducted with library vendors that have developed these services. Such work included drafting of multiple comprehensive question lists distributed to the vendors, onsite vendor visits, and continual tracking of service enhancements. Together, feedback gained from library staff, insights arrived at by the Discovery Task Force, and information gathered from vendors collectively informed the recommendation of a service for the UNLV Libraries.

AB	Discovery tools are emerging in libraries. These tools offer library patrons the ability to concurrently search the library catalog and journal articles. While vendors rush to provide feature-rich interfaces and access to as much content as possible, librarians wonder about the usefulness of these tools to library patrons. To learn about both the utility and usability of EBSCO Discovery Service, James Madison University (JMU) conducted a usability test with eight students and two faculty members. The test consisted of nine tasks focused on common patron requests or related to the utility of specific discovery tool features. Software recorded participants' actions and time on task, human observers judged the success of each task, and a post-survey questionnaire gathered qualitative feedback and comments from the participants. Participants were successful at most tasks, but specific usability problems suggested some interface changes for both EBSCO Discovery Service and JMU's customizations of the tool. The study also raised several questions for libraries above and beyond any specific discovery-tool interface, including the scope and purpose of a discovery tool versus other library systems, working with the large result sets made possible by discovery tools, and navigation between the tool and other library services and resources. This article will be of interest to those who are investigating discovery tools, selecting products, integrating discovery tools into a library web presence, or performing evaluations of similar systems.

AB	From 2012 the 'traditional' OPAC will be switched off and the Primo interface of 'Explore the British Library' will be the search, discovery and access portal of the British Library. Before any training programme for our readers could be considered, a substantial and long term development programme needed to be developed, reviewed, regularly updated and initially delivered to 75 front line staff. It was then expanded to include all 1,700 staff across 3 UK locations. Explore the British Library' is the search, discovery and access portal which over the past 3 years has morphed from a beta catalogue, to the discovery and access resource it is today. Underlying this minor technological revolution has been a growing cultural change within. The search experience for the user is through an 'Amazon-style' interface with social networking capabilities but the search refinement functionality of a traditional library catalogue is maintained. This paper will explore the options considered and solutions identified to deliver a focused staff training programme. It will also cover the production of a set of professional competencies identified for a 21st Century Librarian. The challenge of fostering a sense of ownership of the service and adjusting to the change of service delivery in The British Library will be addressed.

AB	When introducing a web-scale discovery system to students and staff at Sheffield Hallam University (SHU), we needed to rethink our approach to how we taught information literacy in this millennial, Net Generation age. Library staff needed to re-evaluate how to introduce information literacy to students and allay faculty staff fears of "dumbing down" the library experience. Although much literature exists on teaching information literacy, not much exists on the way that information literacy can be taught in a web-discovery world. The librarian's traditional role of content gatekeeper is perhaps contentious, but well acknowledged. This paper argues that this focus is no longer relevant, and that a shift in focus toward a first class user experience of accessing content must be made. We provide an historical overview of information literacy teaching at SHU, and describe how the introduction of a web-scale discovery system made us challenge our existing methods of supporting students with information literacy teaching and online help resources. The paper demonstrates how we moved away from the traditional information literacy teaching approach of focusing on content towards providing a first class user experience of content access, and how we used Shoshin, a Zen Buddhist concept, to help us along the way.

AB	In 2009, President Barack Obama declared October of that year to be National Information Literacy Awareness Month and issued a proclamation stating that "an informed and educated citizenry is essential to the functioning of our modern democratic society." The Obama proclamation's emphasis on information literacy's role in education and democracy makes it akin to the 2005 Alexandria Proclamation on Information Literacy and Lifelong Learning. In both of these documents, information literacy is located at the core of lifelong learning. It empowers people in all walks of life to seek, evaluate, use, and create information effectively to achieve their personal, social, occupational, and educational goals. These two documents are powerful and inspiring to many academic librarians because they are reminders of the broader social context and democratic initiatives within their work. Inspiring as these documents are, they can also be intimidating and overwhelming: how can we help create an informed and educated citizenry or help our students meet technological, economic, and social challenges, to redress disadvantage and to advance the well-being of all? This article is not an attempt to provide answers to these questions but a call to move these questions to the fore of our policy and pedagogical discussions. By revisiting seminal documents like the Alexandria Proclamation, the Association of College and Research Libraries' Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, and the American Library Association's (ALA) Core Values of Librarianship, we argue that information literacy is full of possibilities to explore rather than problems to be solved. To this end, we summon discussions of Appreciative Inquiry and critical information literacy and foreground the ALA Core Values as ways to reengage with the possibilities and potentials within information literacy to meet larger social goals.

AB	We investigate the extent to which open-access (OA) journals and articles in biology, computer science, economics, history, medicine, and psychology are indexed in each of 11 bibliographic databases. We also look for variations in index coverage by journal subject, journal size, publisher type, publisher size, date of first OA issue, region of publication, language of publication, publication fee, and citation impact factor. Two databases, Biological Abstracts and PubMed, provide very good coverage of the OA journal literature, indexing 60 to 63% of all OA articles in their disciplines. Five databases provide moderately good coverage (22-41%), and four provide relatively poor coverage (0-12%). OA articles in biology journals, English-only journals, high-impact journals, and journals that charge publication fees of $1,000 or more are especially likely to be indexed. Conversely, articles from OA publishers in Africa, Asia, or Central/South America are especially unlikely to be indexed. Four of the 11 databases index commercially published articles at a substantially higher rate than articles published by universities, scholarly societies, nonprofit publishers, or governments. Finally, three databases-EBSCO Academic Search Complete, Pro-Quest Research Library, and Wilson OmniFile-provide less comprehensive coverage of OA articles than of articles in comparable subscription journals.

AB	Background/Context: This essay is a part of a special issue that emerges from a year-long faculty seminar at Teachers College, Columbia University. The seminar's purpose has been to examine in fresh terms the nexus of globalization, education, and citizenship. Participants come from diverse fields of research and practice, among them art education, comparative education, curriculum and teaching, language studies, philosophy of education, social studies, and technology. They bring to the table different scholarly frameworks drawn from the social sciences and humanities. They accepted invitations to participate because of their respective research interests, all of which touch on education in a globalized world. They were also intrigued by an all-too-rare opportunity to study in seminar conditions with colleagues from different fields, all of whom they might otherwise never interact given the harried conditions of university life today. Participants found the seminar generative in terms of ideas about globalization, education, and citizenship. Participants also appreciated what, for them, became a novel and rich occasion for professional and personal growth.Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Participants also brought to this study together their own subjective experiences of education, citizenship, and globalization, and its nexus as lived in our times. As they acknowledged and shared such stories with each other, they began to experience something new and fresh together, even renewing and refreshing in the face of professional and personal pressures, forces often also felt to be accelerating, dominating, alienating, even dehumanizing. Participants began to describe this nexus itself in terms of the experience of and encounter with something 'new,' even perhaps perpetually so. Quinn, locating such subjectivity at the heart of her queries, attempts to explore this relationship to the new, and the stories that are told of it, as inspired by Arendt's concept of natality, defined as the essence of education, the fact that new beings are ever born into the world.Conclusions/Recommendations: While eschewing definitive findings, conclusions, or recommendations-rather hoping to cultivate new questions, experiences, and stories of our times, and summon us to renewed responsibility, she undertakes an experiment in reconceiving the '3 R's at the rendezvous of education, citizenship, and globalization: on, and as, natality in our roots, routes and relations. She asks: What new understandings may be born of looking at this nexus anew, as a narration of natality? Is ours a moment of labor, of delivering the new or being delivered up to the new? To the experience of the new, raised to the level of a question? What new stories, and stories of the new, concerning such might we tell? Particularly those that testify to and honor our roots, routes, and relations with hospitality, humanity, and hope? In our context, how do we ever-as our situation now seems to perpetually require-begin again anew? How do we engage and describe such experience faithfully and fruitfully ... singularly and together? If we consider subjectivity as the subject of globalization, citizenship, and education-the birth of new subjectivity underway at its present nexus, what (re)thinking does such make possible?

AB	The studies global warming problem conducted in education discipline in the world and in Turkey were analysed for this study. The literature was reviewed extensively especially through the articles in the indexed journals of Ebsco Host, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis and Web of Science databases and this study was conducted according to the descriptive method. 62 scientific publications about global warming which were published between the years 1992 and 2009 were included in the research. The articles obtained as a result of this review process were analyzed by taking the aims, results and the education levels into consideration. As a result of the research, some studies which didn't complement one another both in the world and in Turkey were encountered. However, for the most part the studies conducted had similar purposes and they had the same results. Descriptive studies introduced that similar misconceptions related to global warming existed in all levels of education and the media had negative effects during this process. Experimental studies revealed that the education methods where the students are active, visual materials and social activities outside the school were more effective methods in educating more conscious students about global warming.

AB	When the third is dead: Memory, mourning, and witnessing in the aftermath of the Holocaust. - The origins of psychoanalysis, as well as the concerns of our daily endeavors, center on engagement with the fate of the unbearable - be it wish, affect, or experience. In this paper, the author explores psychological states and dynamics faced by survivors of genocide and their children in their struggle to sustain life in the midst of unremitting deadliness. Toward this continuous effort, he re-examines Freud's theoretical formulations concerning memory and mourning, elaborates Andre Green's concept of the 'Dead Mother', and introduces more recent work on the concepts of the 'third' and 'thirdness'. Throughout, his thoughts are informed by clinical experience with the essential role of witnessing in sustaining life after massive trauma. He brings aspects of all these forms of knowing to reflections about a poem by Primo Levi entitled 'Unfinished business' and to our own never finished business of avoiding denial while living in an age of genocide and under the aura of uncontained destructiveness.

AB	Relationship marketing develops marketing productivity and builds up mutual values for customers and sellers by creating effective and long-lasting relationships. Considering factors that help to maintain such relationships can provide advantages for both parties. This study evaluates the impact of customer's perceived service quality on relationship commitment, relationship satisfaction and trust as relationship marketing orientations and then examines the influence of these dimensions on customers' buying behavior in a B2C relationship from the customer perspective in insurance industry. In order to conduct this study, a model is provided and empirically tested. Consequently, primary data has been collected by a properly designed questionnaire which was distributed among health insurance customers from three different hospitals in Malaysia and the secondary data has been collected through online data base such as Ebsco, Science Direct and Emerald. Afterward, SPSS (17.0) tool has been used and correlation and regression analysis determined the relationship between the model's variables. Finally, results showed significant relationships between customers' perceived service quality as independent variable and relationship satisfaction and trust as dependent variables. On the other hand, the relationship between customers' perceived service quality and relationship commitment is not supported in this study. Meanwhile, based on the results, there is significant relationship between relationship commitment, relationship satisfaction and trust and the customers buying behavior in a B2C relationship.

AB	Purpose - The study described in this paper aims to identify the progress made in the efforts to model current online public access catalogs (OPACs) after the next generation catalog (NGC) in academic libraries in the USA and Canada.Design/methodology/approach - A random sample of 260 colleges and universities was selected from Peterson's Guide to Four-Year Colleges 2009, an estimated 10 percent of the total population of 2,560 listed academic institutions. A checklist of 12 features of the NGC was used to evaluate the OPACs of the 260 libraries in the sample. The authors took as the OPAC that which the library linked to as its "catalog," even though some might be more properly considered "discovery tools" or "discovery layers." Some libraries used more than one OPAC interface simultaneously; in this case, each OPAC was analyzed separately. In the case of several institutions using the same consortial OPAC, only the first instance of the OPAC was analyzed. About 15 percent of the institutions (n = 40) in the sample either did not have web sites or did not provide access to their online catalogs. In all, a total of 233 unique instances of OPACs were analyzed. Data were collected from September 2009 through July 2010. The findings can be extrapolated to the population at the 95 percent confidence level with a confidence interval of +/- 3.Findings - While bits and pieces of the next generation catalog are steadily working themselves into the current catalog, academic libraries still have a long way to go. About 16 percent of the OPACs in the sample did not show any advanced features of the NGC. More than half of the libraries (61 percent) had only one to five advanced features in their OPACs. Many of those with six or more NGC features were discovery tools. Only 3 percent of the OPACs in the sample (n = 8) demonstrated seven to ten out of the 12 functionalities of the NGC, and they were instances either of WorldCat Local or Summon. The weak areas were federated searching, relevance based on circulation statistics, and recommendations based on patron transactions.Originality/value - This is the first and only study on a large scale conducted thus far that evaluates the progress towards the NGC in academic libraries in the USA and Canada. The findings help academic librarians to recognize and pin-point the weak links in implementing a true next generation catalog.

AB	The term 'information ethics' (IE) is rapidly diversifying as new technologies enter the milieu and add to already existing 'entanglements'. Unsurprisingly, the term lacks a universally accepted definition, although there is some common ground as to its constitution. This paper explores the term using the most commonly co-occurring terms in IE literature as indexed in nine databases, namely the EBSCO-hosted Academic Search Premier (ASP); Communication and Mass Media Complete; ERIC; Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA); Newspaper Complete; Business Premier; and Master File Premier, and Wilson's Library Literature and Information Science (LLIS) Full Text. Core/periphery analysis, the co-occurrence of words as subject terms, and social network techniques were applied using UCINET for Windows, text STAT and Bibexcel computer-aided software to analyze data. The paper identifies the most common terms used to describe IE and the core terms with which IE can be defined. Other than informing LIS research and education, the results could potentially assist with the development of IE taxonomy and definitions (e. g. in understanding IE content and development) that may apply to the intercultural and global understanding of IE.

Moreover, it intends to elicit the barriers in use of e-information with recommendations for the improvement of services and usage of e-resources.Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the use of electronic resources by students of business schools of Orissa (India) through structured questionnaires. SPSS is used for data analysis.Findings - The study finds that students express keen interest in the use of e-journals, followed by e-books, e-newspapers, e-reports, and e-articles. Least interest is shown towards the use of electronic theses and dissertations. The study reveals that the majority of students are aware of EBSCO, and Emerald Management Xtra. However, the awareness of all other databases is not quite so encouraging. Further, it is revealed that the use of printed materials is slightly more compared to that of e-resources. Use of Web OPAC is also less than expected.Practical implications - The paper highlights the practicality of the use of electronic resources, compared to print, among the students of business schools of Orissa (India).Originality/value - The paper reveals the degree of use of electronic resources by business students and makes some useful deductions for its subsequent generalization.

TI	Making Knowledge Sharing Working in Healthcare: Relevant Factors and Strategies
SO	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, VOLS 1 AND 2
BP	785
EP	793
PD	2010
PY	2010
AB	Context: Hospitals are knowledge-intensive organizations and the adoption of knowledge management practices is critical for performance improvement and the dissemination of innovations. Since many efforts to implement knowledge sharing systems have failed, hospital managers still have to figure out how knowledge sharing can be successfully promoted among physicians. In fact, knowledge sharing is acknowledged as an activity that it is impossible to measure, monitor and, thus, mandate. Thus, it depends mostly on individuals' willingness to share. Many scholars from Management, Medicine and Information Systems have provided a wide range of factors and interventions that may increase individuals' intentions. Despite this wealth, though, these three bodies of literature have often produced diverging results. Purpose: This paper aims at reconciling the existing understanding of both the factors that affect knowledge sharing in hospitals and the interventions that should be pursued by hospital managers in order to promote it. The authors propose a comprehensive framework which classifies the factors based on the impact they have on physicians' willingness to share. In this regard, the Theory of Planned Behaviour was chosen as the most appropriate framework to conciliate the often diverging findings. Methodology: The authors carried an electronic literature search covering Ebsco, Proquest and Pubmed databases. 52 articles were chosen as relevant. Results: Seventeen factors were recognised as significant contributors to knowledge sharing and were classified based on three possible influences on physicians' willingness to share: (a) changing physicians' perception of its costs and benefits; (b) establishing external pressures to comply to it; (c) changing physicians' perception of control over its feasibility and consequences. Twelve interventions address these factors and were recognized as possible solutions to knowledge sharing problems. These interventions were classified based on three underlying strategies: (a) eliciting knowledge sharing; (b) codifying information into explicit knowledge; (c) building social and technological ties between potential sharers.

This paper aims to investigate a variety of alert services provided by four online information vendors.Design/methodology/approach - A comparison of the alert services of major online information providers (Ebsco, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Scopus) used by the Central Library of Tarbiat Modares University in Iran was undertaken. These alert services were evaluated using a check-list and their structure and service were compared with regard to the quantity and quality of received alerts. The subject area of library and information science was used for the study.Findings - No relative significance was found between the total alerts' relevance and the size of the databases of journal articles. ProQuest was found to have a more reliable alert system and it provided more relevant alert results than the other services. Users should recognise that additional services, such as alert services, are a useful help to their information-seeking behaviour. Library managers should regard alert services as an effective tool for current awareness purposes. However, careful attention should be given to the differences and structures of the services offered. Alert quantity does not necessarily mean good performance.Originality/value - University libraries and information centres pay a lot of money annually to online information providers. Alert systems could reduce the time users spend seeking for information by providing quick access to new information. Therefore, performing a study to investigate the functionality of the alert systems seems appropriate.

AB	This paper reports a review of studies of perceptions about poverty and the poor. The method consist in a quantitative review based on a systematic search in international databases (Ebsco, Pro quest, Redalyc, Dialnet, Wiley Interscience, Psycnet Psycinfo, Psycarticles and Sage) of randomized studies, published from January 1970 to April 2009, that attempt to explore how different social groups perceived poverty and poor from the analysis of variables such as attributions, beliefs, perceptions, and explanations. Results show that most researches have been carried out in developed countries, or zones where poor people do not represent the largest proportion of the population, and with samples of students and communities that have not effect on public policies or private initiatives to improve the quality of lives of these people.

AB	Until recently, Croatian scientific journals were accessible only in print form and only to a relatively small audience. A national online journals platform was therefore planned to offer publishers a simple toot for building online versions of their journals and to make them open access. The platform, named Hrcak, was launched in 2006, supported by governmental funds. It currently includes 170 open access (OA) journals. Most journals include backfiles from 2006 onwards; die average archived period is 6.3 years. 56.5% of the journals come from the fields of social sciences and humanities. Metadata from the Hrcak platform are regularly harvested by CIA repositories. To increase the number of Croatian journals covered by relevant bibliographic and full-text databases, Hrcak has forged links with Elsevier, Thomson Reuters and EBSCO. So far, the main achievements include assisting publishers in the process of electronic publishing, and improving accessibility to Croatian scientific output.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce the functional framework of a subject service virtual communities' platform and implementation planning at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Library.Design/methodology/approach - First, the paper analyses the three aspects which should be considered when libraries carry out subject information services, next points out the users' behavior preferences of scholar communities to use libraries services and access library resources, and then explains the limitation of current methods used by academic libraries to reveal and deliver resources and services. Second, the paper describes the advantages of using a virtual community platform to reveal library subject resources, services, and to construct the communication environment for subject users. Finally, the functional framework of the subject service virtual communities and implementation planning at the Library of Shanghai Jiao Tong University are illustrated.Findings - Based on the next-generation discovery and delivery system - Primo - subject service virtual communities at Shanghai Jiao, Tong University Library integrate diverse functions as follows to one platform: Subject information discovery and accessing (subject information letters, subject information gateway, subject information one-stop search), Subject information blog, Subject information literacy instruction, Subject information generation and preservation, Subject information consultation. Besides "one-stop" accessing and obtaining only needed library resources and services, the virtual communities platform gives subject users a more convenient and more attractive environment to preserve their research results and share their experiences.Originality/value - Subject service at Chinese academic libraries has become a hot topic in recent years. Advice on how to support the service and make it become more effective and attractive is also an important problem. This article covers various library systems and tools that can be used to build subject service virtual communities and shows it is valuable and could be tried elsewhere.

Respondents were asked to rank their top used journals in terms of use for teaching, outreach and research.Findings - A total of 143 surveys were completed. Journal of Business Logistics, Harvard Business Review, and International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management were the top three ranked journals in the composite index. EBSCO Business Source Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar were the top three search engines used to find logistics and SCM articles.Research limitations/implications - A clear global consensus is forming on the top journals for SCM. However, the emergence of Operations Management/Operations Research Journals into the rankings is an important trend. There was also the absence of previously ranked journals as the field evolved from transportation and distribution to logistics to SCM.Originality/value - This paper is the largest survey completed to date in the field and substantially updates previous surveys. All academics who are active in SCM will find value in this paper.

AB	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that the development of the "Knowledge Portal" is an attempt to develop a central access system in terms of a "single point of access" for all electronic information services. This means that all these sources - from the library's catalogue and full-text in-house applications to external, licensed sources - should be accessible via one central web service.Design/methodology/approach - The Knowledge Portal is a piece of software and a real library application, based on Primo, a commercial product, which has been enhanced through a cooperative project from ETH Libraries (Libraries of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) and ExLibris. The new portal will be the result of integrating this new metasearch and the library's homepage.Findings - The paper gives an overview of the general idea behind this complex and clearly user-oriented project and shows which steps are necessary for its launch.Originality/value - The paper gives an example of how to organize cooperation between quite different project partners and shows the complexity of setting up a portal as the single point of access.

AB	On reading Primo Levi's Holocaust memoir If This is a Man, one is immediately struck by its literary quality, and especially its generous use of Dante's Inferno, both of which point to the more general problem of Holocaust witnessing. This paper focuses on Levi's reasons for using Dante's poem in particular to communicate his experience. Levi's choice of Inferno is pointed, not only because of the obvious trope of existence in Hell, but also because Levi conceived of Auschwitz as an experiment designed to destroy the "human," created in part, at least in the West, by Dante's poem. What I will be suggesting is that Levi emphasizes the distinctions between his and Dante's experiences by including in his conversation with Dante's Inferno (paradoxically) his rejection of that conversation. There may or may not be something "human" which persists after Auschwitz, and the only way to ask this question, without preconceiving an answer, is to dramatize silence. The resultant ambiguity urges readers to, as Levi puts it, "participate in" the events described and/or dramatized.

AB	This article presents one part of a wider study, performed at the Department of library and information science and book studies (LIS & BS) at the University of Ljubljana (UL). The study investigated the perceptions of user friendliness of information-retrieval systems (IRS) and the role of individual characteristics of users in these perceptions. Based on an expert study, a user study with 61 postgraduate students of the UL was performed. Three interfaces of e-journals were studied: Science Direct, Proquest Direct, and Ebsco Host. Questionnaires and observations were used for data collection. The users' perceptions of user friendliness and of importance of auxiliary functions were investigated. Also, the connections between these perceptions and the users' individual characteristics were identified. Three sets of individual characteristics were included: approaches to studying, thinking styles, and hemisphere leanings. In connection with the dimensions of individual characteristics, very different perceptions of user friendliness were expressed. Some dimensions of individual characteristics were also found to be connected to the users' academic areas. It is shown that participants from different academic areas have different requirements and perceptions of user friendliness. The results of the study are relevant for the design of the user interfaces of disciplinary IR systems. They also have implications for other areas, for example, user education and training.

AB	Problems of communication often arise when social research is to be used as premises for policy making. In this paper it is argued that the two activities are entirely different, yet that there is a logical parallelism between theory construction and policy making which can be identified in four steps. Where scientists make observations, politicians raise issues. Where scientists propose explanations, politicians propose remedies. Where scientists draw empirical consequences and make predictions from their models, politicians work out possible political implications of their proposals. Where scientists rule out explanations when the predictions from them do not correspond to facts, politicians rule out options or reforms that are not feasible or workable. Where scientists try to explain the actual world, politicians attempt to create possible worlds. Both professions not only demand acuity and test imagination but also summon the capacity to spot import and resolve controversies.

AB	The aim of this article is the analysis of available treatments for battered women who present PTSD, whose efficacy have been put to the test. The applied strategy consisted of a bibliographic search of the available studies in the Medline, EBSCO and Lilacs database. Besides, reference bibliography has been consulted. Three approach models were found, supported by a scarce number of studies. Unfortunately none of these models was investigated by independent researchers, limiting the results conclusive power. Nevertheless, the results suggest that Cognitive Therapy for Trauma in Battered Women would be established as treatment of choice. Clinical implications as well as limitations for the generalization of the obtained results, are discussed.

It examines the level of awareness by academic staff of digital library resources along with their use rate and to evaluate the preferences of faculty for specific electronic databases case studies were undertaken by means of separate questionnaires in both years.Findings - Findings were consistent that positive results have been observed in two studies conducted in two years, 2002 and 2005. According to the results of the current survey, increased numbers of the faculty members of Ankara University know about the existence of the digital library. Another result of the survey is that many of the faculty members, although not all, use electronic databases. The most preferred databases have been Web of Science, Science Direct and Ebsco. When use of the electronic databases is analyzed, in respect of faculty rank and level of awareness, associate and assistant professors, assistants are ranked first.Originality/value - The study presents the first case study in the field in Turkey that compares the current situation of the digital library usage with the initial survey data.

AB	Wiki's, blogs and social networking have created a new mode of communication and presentation of information on the Internet. Local in-house databases that were developed in the Caribbean around the 1990's have not incorporated these new changes and in recent years there have been an increasing number of scientific commercial database providers that have embraced this new technology. As a result, many persons now question the validity and relevance of local in-house databases in today's changing technological environment. This paper will focus on three Caribbean scientific databases, Caribbean Environmental Network (CAREN), Caribbean Disaster Information Network (CARDIN) and MEDCARIB that are available at the University of the West Indies Library, Mona Campus. The coverage of Caribbean scientific issues in these Caribbean databases were compared with four commercial databases, EBSCO Academic Search Premier, OCLC First Search Wilson Select Plus, Proquest, and SciFinder Scholar. The paper sought to validate why Caribbean databases are still relevant in an age where information is readily available globally.

AB	Purpose - The paper aims to present a part of a wider study. performed at the Department of LIS&BS at the University of Ljubljana (UL). The study investigated the perceptions of user friendliness of information retrieval (IR) systems.Design/methodology/approach - An expert study and a user study were performed. The user study was based on the results of the previous expert study, which surveyed the interfaces of four e-journal IR systems (Science Direct, Proquest Direct, Ebsco Host and Emerald) and has been published separately. In the user study three of these interfaces were used: Science Direct, Proquest Direct, and Ebsco Host. A pilot study with ten subjects and a main study with 61 subjects, all postgraduate students of the UL, was performed. Questionnaires and observation were used for data collection. The users perceptions of user interfaces were investigated and compared to the finding's of the expert study.Findings - It was found that users do not show high appreciation of auxiliary functions (Such as search history, indexes, etc.) and do not use them to a great extent. They also do not prefer to have available different full-text formats. Perception,, of user friendliness of elements and functions were different in each interface. For each interface it was also established that different functions and elements; were influential in the overall perceptions of the interface friendliness. In comparison of the findings of the expert and user study it was found that the expert study was in some cases too detailed and investigated aspects not perceived by the users. For this reason, certain findings of both studies were not appropriate for comparison.Research limitations/implications - The methodology of data collection was rather demanding and lengthy, and influenced the type and size of sample. Because of that it may not be possible to generalise the result to all users of e-journals. Also, large quantities of data were collected which could be studied further.Practical implications - The results of the study are relevant for the design of the user interfaces of IR systems. They also have implications for other areas. e.g. user education and training.Originality/value - The study investigates the users' own perceptions of user friendliness of the e-journal interfaces and also compares them to the findings of the expert study. This gives a valuable insight and provides many different viewpoints in regard to user friendliness, which in itself is a demanding concept.

AB	Risk is a probabilistic notion which has been used by scientists since the sixteenth century. It is not a perception but a calculation or a narration. This paper proposes an historical perspective to show how risk jumped from mathematical calculation to the narrative. A book by Daniel Defoe, A Journal of the Plague Year, which was published in 1720, is the best example of an early narrative of risk. Together with the example of Defoe's book, some ethnographic episodes from Spain are described and analysed: the protest against the Almaraz nuclear power station, the sinking of the Prestige and the subsequent oil slick, the flooding of a campsite in Biescas where 86 people died. This paper suggests an exploration into the narratives of evil, harm and suffering to classify them in terms of uncertainty, risk, fear, panic and terror. The Diaries of Viktor Klemperer (1996) are used as the narrative material to be interpreted in order to identify different kinds of narrative. Also the literature written by some of the Holocaust survivors, Primo Levi for example, becomes a very relevant source to understand how the identity of victims comes from a narrative challenge: to tell the truth.

AB	In a previous paper, we introduced a biologically inspired binocular vision system, the CogV, that exhibits partial characteristics of human vision and attention. To further the work, the investigation focused onto partitioning the image space into regions of interests that may simulate exogenous attention. The first step for human to perceive an environment is through a series of attention cues that may summon portions of edges, regions, colors, and prevailing thoughts in order to understand the prevailing environment. Through this process, the brain then decides to focus on some region to extract further information from it. This paper proposes a fast color image segmentation algorithm which may be used for vision applications. This approach is based on Fast Learning Artificial Neural Networks (FLANN) clustering and segmentation based on coherence between neighboring pixels. The proposed segmentation algorithm has been incorporated into the existing CogV system as a simplified model that we relate loosely to the Superior Colliculus (SC). The purpose of this module is to gain an initial overall perception of the environment and highlight regions of interest that the perceptual system may concern itself with. In the process, the SC provides a means to detect exogenous; stimuli and thus reducing the initial search domain for object positions.

AB	The increasing uncertainty context, in which individuals' professional paths are taking form today, is the occasion to a critical renewal of career course analysis models. In the first part of the article, we argue with the model propounded by Power and Rothausen (2003), which aims to analyse and support mid-career professional orientation behaviours, by extending the Super's career maintenance stage. We partly break free with them, defending the conception of an active socialisation, which analysis of orientation behaviours is based on the conjoined study of temporal perspectives and of exchanges between life domains. This point of view is supported by results from a research dealing with future temporal perspectives reconstruction processes of individuals confronted with the unemployment uncertainty. They show that individuals do not project in the future only by striving for yielding "employable". Their projects do not only result from the rational control of the information related to the anticipated professional environment. Ascribed to peculiar paths, those projects summon up processes of values confrontation and comparisons with others, in the plurality of individuals' life fields.

AB	The study of mediatized rituals challenges entrenched theoretical views about media power, its locations and determinations and the role of media in processes of manufacturing consent. Contrary to both Durkheimian and neo-Marxian traditions (historically the dominant frameworks in the field of ritual study), some mediatized rituals appear to open up productive spaces for social reflexivity and critique, and can be politically disruptive or even transformative in their reverberations within civil and wider societies. This article identifies and critically discusses six subclasses of mediatized ritual and produces an overarching schema of use in their empirical analysis and comparative theorization. It argues against the deep theoretical suspicions within current academic media discourse toward ritual, and illustrates how mediatized rituals are in fact complexly variegated, exceptional and performative phenomena that periodically summon solidarities and moral ideas of the 'social good' and variously serve to exert agency within late modem societies.

AB	Clustering has been known as a popular technique for pattern recognition, image processing, and data mining. Unfortunately, all known clustering algorithms tend to break down in high dimensional spaces; this is due to the inherent sparsity of the points. We investigate, in this paper, the use of linear and nonlinear principal manifolds for learning lox, dimensional representations for clustering. Several leading methods: PCA, %PCA, Summon, and CCA are examined and tested in clustering experiments using synthetic and real datasets from the UCI Databases. We compare the clustering performance of the g means algorithm on data projected by these projection methods. The experimental results show that K -means clustering on data projected by %PCA outperforms those projected by the three other methods.

AB	This Connexions essay aims to reflect on the nature, rationale, and implications for research and researchers of conducting case studies. It draws on the works of Prima Levi and Giorgio Agamben on the meaning of the testimony and the paradox of Auschwitz: only those who died could fully testify the atrocities of the camp, but they tragically passed away. Thus each testimony presents a lacuna, and one needs to listen to the voices coming from this empty space to comprehend what happened. For organizational scholars, this paradox metaphorically implies that listening to managers and interviewees has nothing to do with telling what could be seen (a fact) and rather relates to what is missing (a lacuna) and thus the issue is one of investigating this absence (this space left empty by whichever testimony). This opens some ethical questions: What is the role of researchers in this investigation? Where does their 'authority' to narrate come from? What are they 'authorized' to recount? And with what consequences? Are researchers ineluctably perpetrators of a domination in the absence (and in the name) of the Other or is there an escape from this?

AB	Mainly based on the testimony of Primo Levi in Si c'est un homme, and through a perspective inspired by the "interactionist" approach of E. Goffman, this article first aims at analysing the depersonalizing methods and techniques which were implemented by the Nazi institution on the detainees of Auschwitz concentration camp. Second. the article studies the tactics, the stratagems, the savoir-faire unevenly shared according to each prisoner's resources - by which means the oppressed tried to ''put life back together". Our approach is completely opposed to the idea that prisoners, "like lambs sent to slaughter", passively suffered the injunctions of the concentration institution.

AB	As a result of several well-publicized media scandals involving plagiarism and outright fabrication, the authors question whether online database providers are appending or linking corrections to original stories. Unfortunately, in most cases, the answer is no. In this study of how some major database providers (EBSCO, LexisNexis, ProQuest, and Thomson/Gale) handle highly publicized cases of plagiarism and fabrication, only LexisNexis was found to append corrections, and even then inconsistently. Databases are not alone in this oversight; even the Web sites of the publications involved were unreliable in their treatment of corrections of their own articles.

They narrate turning points, setbacks, and triumphs that show their struggles to evolve as intellectuals deeply committed to embodying the beneficial interrelations among their public and private dialogues. Their goal is to summon the reader and listener to reflect on her or his own ideas about the inherent embeddedness of intellectual and personal life in mentoring relationships. Their hope is that through showing, telling, doing, and witnessing, this performance space enables moments of reflexivity among listeners and readers.

Given the volume of literature produced in this field, a columnist cannot claim comprehensive coverage. This column seeks to provide a broad, representative survey of literature that illustrates significant trends in the field.Entries were identified through searches of bibliographic databases such as Library Literature, PAIS International, Ebsco Academic Elite, The Index to Legal Periodicals and Books, Science Direct, Westlaw's JLR database, WorldCat, and from manual scans of journals, newsletters, and Internet sites. Citations are to monographs and serials, journal and periodical articles, books, newsletters, and Internet sites. Coverage for this edition of the column includes items from 2002 and 2003, with a smattering of 2001 items that have come to my attention since the last installment of this column. Each citation is listed once under its primary topic and annotated if its content cannot be adequately determined from the title. Book reviews and Internet site reviews are generally excluded.Contributions and suggestions for the next column may be addressed to the column editor at the address below.Material for this column is grouped into the following categories: Freedom of Information/Secrecy, E-Gov/Technology, Archives/Libraries/History, Government Printing Office, Federal, State/Local, and International.

AB	This article indicates the extent to which the literary testimony Primo Levi has given of the Nazi extermination camps can be read as an expression of the desire to communicate traumatic experience. Dependent on addressees able and willing to face up to the testimony of a survivor, the first German publication of If This is a Man (1961) was a specific challenge for Levi, an experience he gives a precise account of in the last work written before his suicide in 1987. The deficits displayed by German readers in the ability to square up to this survivor's testimony stand revealed as an essential condition of post-war culture, not only in Germany.

AB	Although Critical Race Theory (CRT) originated in the legal arena, its influence has proliferated throughout the social sciences literature. Yet CRT has not spread significantly into the field of educational leadership, where the discourse on diversity has failed to penetrate the salience of racism in schooling. The purpose of this article is to confront the silence on race in schools and to summon scholars in the politics of education to critical analysis of race as an issue in public schools.

AB	The Mazatlan Academic Unit Library was built in 1976 and provided some services in a very limited manner. It wasn't until 1983, when its formal organization began as a "Marine Science Library" and offering library services to internal and external users. Progressively, more documents were incorporated and from 1986, the thematic organization of the collection and its respective catalogue manuals was undertaken, using for that purpose an appropriate infrastructure. On November 6, 1991 the library was named "Dra. Maria Elena Caso" in honor of a distinguished scientist who worked at the Institute of Marine Science and Limnology on the Mexico City campus. In 1991, the incorporation of the collection into the database was started. At present there are about 650 titles of journals (more than 17,500 issues), approximately 2,800 books, more than 498 undergraduate and postgraduate theses, as well as more than 10,800 reprints. We are aware of the importance of a library specialized in marine science and limnology, in the last six years it has grown constantly, both in terms of space and the collection. Since 1996 the library has been affiliated with the IAMSLIC. From the year 2000, it has access to databases, full-text (e-journals) such as ELSEVIER, KLUWER, EBSCO, SWESNET, IDEAL, etc. and abstracts such as the Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, current contents, etc., as well as software and updated technology. A consultation service to internal and external users is provided and offers a photocopying service, as well as advice in consulting the database on line of e-journals of both abstract and full-text to which the UNAM is subscribed. Currently, book, theses, periodical publications, memoirs, and reports catalogues are available on our web page: http://ola.icmyl.unarrLmx/biblio.

AB	Attention deployment and generating specific types of cognitions are central cognitive mechanisms of emotion regulation. Two groups of hypotheses make contradicting predictions about the emotion-cognition relationship. The mood-congruency hypothesis expects the emergence of mood-congruent cognitions (i.e., negative mood leads to negative and positive mood to positive cognitions). Similarly, a substantial body of research suggests that negative mood induces self-focus, whereas positive mood elicits an external focus of attention. The mood-repair hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that persons in a negative mood state summon thoughts incongruent with that state and divert attention away from the self. However, the temporal sequence of cognitions assessed as well as coping dispositions, such as vigilance and cognitive avoidance, may moderate these relationships. Positive and negative emotional states were elicited by exposing the participants to the experience of success or failure in a demanding cognitive task. Cognitions that were present after emotion induction were assessed by means of a thought-listing procedure. For the total sample, results clearly confirmed the mood-congruency hypothesis. Thought order was a critical factor only for changes in self-focus. Thought valence (positive, neutral, negative) as well as self-focus were substantially influenced by coping dispositions.

AB	This paper describes the creation of the Suffolk Libraries and Heritage virtual reference library in the UK and its links with the Co-East project. In particular this case study reviews a pilot experiment in four small rural libraries, which, for a period of three months, had their reference books removed to test whether they could indeed become virtually resourced. In place of the printed reference sources users were able to access subscription services from Ebsco and KnowUK as well as the Web.

AB	Three different approaches of profile acquisition in a filtering system were compared. The explicit mode allowed users to directly specify the profile, the implicit mode only permitted relevance feedback, and the combined mode allowed users to initialize the profile using explicit means and refine it continuously using relevance feedback. The SIFTER system, designed by the Indiana University Filtering Research Group, was used to conduct a series of experiments. A collection 6000 records retrieved from the Ebsco Health Sources Plus database was the test data set. Eighteen subjects were randomly assigned to three different versions of the system (three experimental levels), and each subject performed 15 sessions. Filtering performance measured using normalized precision showed that the three approaches were significantly different (alpha =0.05 & p=0.012). Overall, it was found that the explicit means of profile acquisition consistently produced superior results. The findings also showed that exclusive reliance on relevance feedback in the implicit mode resulted in inferior performance.

AB	In order to appropriately act in a dynamic environment, any biological or artificial agent needs to be able to locate object boundaries and use them to segregate the objects from each other and from the background. Since contrasts in features such as luminance, color, texture, motion and stereo may signal object boundaries, locations of high feature contrast should summon an agent's attention. In this paper, we present an orientation contrast detection scheme, and show how it can be adapted to work on a cortical data format modeled after the retino-cortical remapping of the visual field in primates. Working on this cortical image is attractive because it yields a high resolution, wide field of view; and a significant data reduction, allowing real-time execution of image processing operations on standard PC hardware. We show how the disadvantages of the cortical image format, namely curvilinear coordinates and the hemispheric divide, can be dealt with by angle correction and filling-in of hemispheric borders.

AB	BadgerLink, the Wisconsin state-funded Internet-based information service, provides access to a range of databases fi om EBSCO and Bell & Howell to qualified institutions and individuals in Wisconsin. Databases available through each vendor make available the full text or abstract and citation information for more than 4,000 periodicals and newspapers. Previously only available to information professionals with online access, the web-based BadgerLink service has now made these databases accessible to hundreds of libraries and countless end users. The recent availability of usage statistics of the service presents a valuable opportunity to evaluate how the service is being used. The authors analyzed six months of usage data, covering the period January 1(st) through June 30(th) 1999, to gain a better understanding of end user information seeking patterns. Data analyzed included databases accessed, periodical and monograph titles selected, document formats viewed, and institutional affiliation. The authors found that searchers tended to limit themselves to default databases on EBSCOhost. The most frequently accessed titles reflect a broad range of information needs, with academic or current event/information sources being most popular. Users took advantage of the full text access in addition to abstract and citation availability. Usage data also indicate that public, academic, and school libraries have been the heaviest users of the service. Implications of the findings for the provision of end user Internet-based information services are discussed.
